<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> "First we must reach to your standard, then we can become interested in spiritual life." It's an envious position. On the material platform they are thinking, "You have gotten so much, now you can afford to practice this. We cannot afford such practice."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is a luxury, it is not necessary. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> Yes, that's what they are thinking. After the material luxury, then you have this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why the Indians, they are not like the Americans? You find in India still millions of people will go to the <span class="Italic">Kumbhamelā</span> with torn cloth. They are not like Americans, riches. Why they take? Indian is well-known poverty-stricken. So why almost ninety-nine percent people, they are after Kṛṣṇa consciousness naturally? Still they'll go, when there is <span class="Italic">Kumbhamelā,</span> so many saintly persons are coming. They will come by <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> Have you seen it? You have seen <span class="Italic">Kumbhamelā</span>? You have seen? That is the proof. Not only <span class="Italic">Kumbhamelā.</span> In Vṛndāvana, just like in our temple, recently it was jam-packed. Why they are coming to Vṛndāvana? Mostly they are coming from villages. Especially during this time at least twenty thousand, fifty thousand men are coming, daily. Still. We held Hare Kṛṣṇa festivals in Calcutta, Bombay, Madras. As soon as it is advertised, you'll find fifteen thousand, twenty thousand men come. And if you hold for weeks, for weeks they will come. You have seen? They are not like Americans, rich. They are all poverty-stricken. To the general eyes they are poverty-stricken. <span class="Italic">Kumbhamelā </span>you'll see, Hardwar, in Vṛndāvana. Or even in big, big cities like Calcutta, Bombay, such festivals are held, people will come by thousands. It is training, culture. And this boy is taking three times bath, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is training and culture. And if he is kept in this culture, in future he'll be great saintly person. Then he'll do everything automatically. He will deliver others. It is training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They got one of those movie projectors-the ones in the small suitcase? With all the films. We were just testing it. They were just testing it downstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We were planning to have..., to show one movie tonight for the guests, that new movie that is made about New Vrindaban. When our other guests arrive we will show it at about eight o'clock. Would you like also to see it again, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no objection. Where it will be shown?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can show it anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Anywhere, we can show it here if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Those little boxes, they also, apart from showing on the screen, they project onto the wall as well if you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is Ali. He was living with us for about four months and chanting sixteen rounds. Then he was taken into the army.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Little bit of army, little bit of <span class="Italic">māyā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> A little bit of army took him, plus a little bit of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He's a very sincere, nice boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So. Let him go on chanting. Chanting cannot be checked, any position. So what is your inquiry further?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> What is your further inquiry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our latest Vṛndāvana report is very encouraging. He has used the word "jam-packed," always people. They are selling good number of magazines, books, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Guesthouse is also filled up. Now we have festival going on nice. Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is your further inquiry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Shahrezad(?):</span> I'm thinking to ask a question. (long pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> There have been very few of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You find out this verse: <span class="Italic">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally, mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge." (Ātreya Ṛṣi translating in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ātreya, when this is going on you cannot talk, then the attention will be diverted. You can later on explain. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "The first six chapters of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga, dhyāna-yoga,</span> and discrimination of the self from matter. However, Kṛṣṇa can only be known by persons who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Paramātmā. The yogis and <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> are confused in their attempts to understand Kṛṣṇa, although the greatest of the impersonalists, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, has admitted in his <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> commentary that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But his followers do not accept Kṛṣṇa as such, for it is very difficult to know Kṛṣṇa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The subject matter itself is difficult. Therefore ordinary persons or a little advanced person cannot understand. And unless one is fully aware of Kṛṣṇa, one cannot become spiritual master. The subject matter itself is difficult. Therefore you don't find many spiritual masters. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda.</div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>anādir ādir govindaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually, the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is not easy. The so-called path of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> may be easy, but when it is practiced factually, according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī writes in his <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-<br class="calibre2"/>pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā<br class="calibre2"/>aikāntikī harer bhaktir<br class="calibre2"/>utpātāyaiva kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [<span class="Italic">Brs.</span> 1.2.101]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">'Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, Nārada-pañcarātra,</span> etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.' It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Paramātmā realized yogi to understand Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yaśodā or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about Kṛṣṇa: <span class="Italic">muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ, māṁ tu veda na kaścana.</span> 'No one knows Me as I am,' the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then <span class="Italic">sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ,</span> 'Such a great soul is very rare.' Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know Kṛṣṇa as He is (<span class="Italic">tattvataḥ</span>), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in Kṛṣṇa, in the cause of all causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because Kṛṣṇa is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:</div>
<div class="Verse">ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi<br class="calibre2"/>na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sevonmukhe hi jihvādau<br class="calibre2"/>svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [<span class="Italic">Brs</span>. 1.2.234]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">'No one can understand Kṛṣṇa as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him.' (<span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa</span>)"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (loud chanting from mosques and singing in background) These words, <span class="Italic">aja,</span> what is the meaning of this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> <span class="Italic">Allah,</span> "God is great, God is great, God is great." "God is greater than can be ever described. I accept and witness that God is one and there is no other partner, or any..."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And glorify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is said five times a day..., three times a day. "Come and be truthful, and remain fortunate, remain truthful, stick to the right path. Come and join in the best activity, which is praise of the Lord. The highest form of activity, which is praise of the Lord." This is <span class="Italic">azan.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Very nice. Nobody hears it.</div>

<div class="Verse">yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra rudra marutaḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair<br class="calibre2"/>vedaiḥ sāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadair gāyanti yaṁ sāma-gāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yogino<br class="calibre2"/>yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇā devāya tasmai namaḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse">In Vedic prayer it is like this. <span class="Italic">Yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇāḥ. Yasya antam,</span> the glories of the Lord, unlimited. So nobody can go to the limit of His glorification, either the <span class="Italic">sura</span> or <span class="Italic">asura,</span> the demons or the demigods. Nobody can reach. But He's glorified by the demigods like, <span class="Italic">yaṁ brahmā,</span> Brahmā, Lord Brahmā, Śiva, Varuṇa, the predominating deity of air, fire, Lord Brahmā. Everyone worships Him, <span class="Italic">yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra stunvanti divyaiḥ stavaiḥ,</span> by glorified prayers. And <span class="Italic">gāyanti yaṁ sāma-gāḥ. Vedaiḥ sāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadaiḥ</span>-by Vedic hymns, by <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad,</span> by Vedic literature. <span class="Italic">Gāyanti yaṁ sāma-gāḥ. Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> The yogis in meditation try to find out Him within the core of the heart. <span class="Italic">Yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇā devāya tasmai namaḥ.</span> The same prayer. The difference is the action. Difference is in the action. So far prayer is concerned, God is great, accepted, either by the Christian or the Muhammadan or the Hindus or the followers of Vedic principles. Now "God is great, glorify Him, and that is the business of human life," that they are not taking. Practically. That is the defect. And that is to be done. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> Brahmā means the great. <span class="Italic">Brhavad brhanantvad iti brahma.(?)</span> Brahmā means the greatest. Now here we get the information God is great. So naturally one should be inquisitive to know how He is great. That is human life. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> Just like if I introduce, "Here is a gentleman, very rich." So naturally next inquiry will be, "How he is rich? What is the position that he is very rich?" These inquiries are natural. If I simply remain satisfied by hearing that he is rich, that is also good. You have got some respect. But if you know how he is rich, to what extent he is rich, then your respect will be increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Your love also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if I understand that he is rich, I may consider, "Well, I have got one thousand dollars, so he may have one hundred thousand dollars," that's all. But if you understand that he has got millions and millions of dollars, then you'll appreciate, "Oh, so rich!" Then your regard for him will increase. That is not being done. Stereotyped, "God is great." How He is great, to what extent He is great, what is His greatness activities, if you know more and more, then your regard for God will increase. But that they are not doing. Simply officially, "God is great, God is great," finished. No <span class="Italic">jijñāsā,</span> no inquiry. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> One should be inquisitive. <span class="Italic">Jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam [SB </span>11.3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who has become inquisitive of the <span class="Italic">uttamam,</span> the most exalted subject matter, he requires a guru. Otherwise, who will answer his inquiries? <span class="Italic">Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ.</span> If he's not <span class="Italic">jijñāsuḥ,</span> what is the need of guru? And where is the question of advancement? He must be <span class="Italic">jijñāsuḥ.</span> That is, people are not interested. Officially, go to church, go to mosque, go to temple and do something. Then drop it and go to your own business and do whatever you like. No discrimination. They're not serious. Not very serious. One who is serious, he'll inquire. Otherwise, the formula is all right, "God is great, there is no more greater than Him." But inquire, "How He is great?" (guests enter) Thank you. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Therefore society is required, association is required, to inquire. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ</span> [SB 3.25.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is need of association for discussing how God is great. That is needed-<span class="Italic">jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam.</span> Unless one is inquisitive... Sharmaji, you can come here. So, that is the... Simply we should not remain satisfied to understand... That is not proper understanding, officially, "God is great." No. Try to inquire how great He is, why He is great. Then your regard for God, your devotion for God will increase. And because we do not inquire how God is great, therefore cheap gods are coming. Any rascal, he is repre... "I am God." Because we do not know actually what is God. But if you inquire about God, if you go through the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse"><i class="calibre3">Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya</i>: the breathing period. We have got idea, breathing period. Within second we are having two, three breathing. So within the breathing period of Mahā-Viṣṇu innumerable universes are coming out. This is greatness. How great is God, it is same idea, that within the breathing period innumerable universes are coming. We cannot conceive of one universe, but we get the information that innumerable universes are coming out during the breathing period. <span class="Italic">Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ [Bs. </span>5.48]<span class="Italic">.</span> That Mahā-Viṣṇu, <span class="Italic">yasya kalā-viśeṣa,</span> part and plenary portion, <span class="Italic">govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span> So when we speak all these things, they'll take it mythology. And a cheap god comes, we'll accept, "Here is God." This is the position. They do not try to understand that actually God is great, how great He is. That is called <span class="Italic">kūpa-maṇḍūka-nyāya,</span> Dr. Frog's philosophy. Dr. Frog is within the well, three feet length and breadth. He's thinking, "This is the ultimate reservoir of water." And when he's informed there is Atlantic Ocean, he simply calculates, "All right, this is three feet. It may be six feet or it may be seven feet; all right, come on, ten feet." He's going like that. So God is not like that, within our calculation. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> when Kṛṣṇa was speaking about the <span class="Italic">vibhūti-yoga,</span> He was speaking "I am this amongst this." Find out this <span class="Italic">vibhūti-yoga,</span> Twelfth Chapter I think it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You want the last verse?</div>

Of all creations I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna. Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the Self, and among logicians I am the conclusive truth. Of letters I am the letter A, and among compounds I am the dual word. I am also inexhaustible time, and of creators I am Brahmā, whose manifold faces turn everywhere. I am all-devouring death, and I am the generator of all things yet to be. Among women I am fame, fortune, speech, memory, intelligence, faithfulness and patience.

O mighty conqueror of enemies, there is no end of My divine manifestation. What I have spoken to you is but a mere indication of My infinite opulences. Know that all beautiful, glorious, and mighty creations spring but from a spark of My splendor. But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is no question of blind faith. Here it is said that "I have explained to you the knowledge, confidential and most confidential. Now you consider about it, and after due consideration, then do whatever you like." But if you actually appreciate that there is God, here is Kṛṣṇa, so whatever He is saying, it is all right. <span class="Italic">Sarvam etad 'ṛtaṁ manye</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no harm even if you accept His word blindly, there is no harm. Otherwise, if you don't like to follow blindly, then consider what is instructed. And then whatever you like, you can do. Both ways are there. But if you have faith in God, "God is saying this, I must do it," that blind faith is as good. Although it is blind faith, it is the fact. Actually it is not blind faith. It is full faith in God. "God is speaking this; I'll accept it." <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> That is the position of <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> Although such <span class="Italic">mahātmās</span> are very rare, but one who accepts this fact that "God is speaking, so let me accept it without any consideration," that is as good as you accept. If gold is real, something real gold is offered to you, you accept it blindly or by checking it, the result is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> But being inquisitive, again, and accepting it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Inquisitive means one who does not accept that "Here is a person giving me gold. He's very good man, he'll not cheat me." Then you accept. But if you have no such faith, then you check it. But real gold, either you take in blind faith or by checking, the result is the same. Now it is up to you. If you believe Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He says... He is the Supreme Person. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> That's a fact. But if you don't believe it, then check and consider of our statement, and then accept. Two ways are there. Why people are misled? They do not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are taking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in their own way. So why they should take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in their own way? That is not good. If you want to speak something better than <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you speak separately. Why you misinterpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? Our preaching process is that you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā's</span> instruction, that is perfect, and you'll be happy. This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Don't try to interpret it. Don't try to exact some meaning of your choice. No, that is not good. You take it as it is, you'll be benefited. Now if you take it, that it is spoken by <span class="Italic">Bhagavān svayam,</span> then it is blind faith. It may be blind faith, but it is right. If you don't want, then Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">iti te jñānam ākhyātaṁ guhyād guhyataraṁ mayā.</span> Then you check it by your knowledge. <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">.</span> Both ways you can accept. Therefore we have to follow <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> Our knowledge is always scanty. So <span class="Italic">mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the way. <span class="Italic">Tarkaḥ apratiṣṭha. Tarka,</span> by argument you'll never come to the conclusion. <span class="Italic">Śrutayor vibhinnam.</span> There are <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> for different persons, in different way they are presented. So they appear to be contradictory from one another. Not contradictory; at least, different from one another. So <span class="Italic">śrutayor vibhinnam. Na cāsav ṛṣir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam.</span> And a great philosopher is not a great philosopher if he does not present a different view. So therefore, the spiritual essence is very confidential. <span class="Italic">Dharmasya tattvaṁ nihita guhyayam.</span>(?)Therefore we have to follow the <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> great personality. That is the system, Vedic system. <span class="Italic">Guru-paramparā.</span> So that <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, mahājana.</span> Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ. Rājarṣi, mahājana. Mahājanas</span> are explained also. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja, he's <span class="Italic">mahājana;</span> Bali Mahārāja, <span class="Italic">mahājana;</span> Brahmā, <span class="Italic">mahājana;</span> Nārada, <span class="Italic">mahājana;</span> Lord Śiva, <span class="Italic">mahājana. Balir vaiyāsakir vayam.</span> Janaka Mahārāja. So we have to follow them. <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: evaṁ paramparā prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So there is no question of blind faith. If we follow the <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> example of the authorities, then our life is success. And guru means he is <span class="Italic">mahājana</span> or follower of <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> So we have to select the <span class="Italic">mahājana</span> process. According to our process, we follow the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sampradāya.</span> And Brahmā is one of the <span class="Italic">mahājanas.</span> So Brahmā has his disciplic succession, <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> Brahmā's disciple is Nārada, Nārada's disciple is Vyāsadeva, and Vyāsadeva's disciple is Śukadeva Gosvāmī. In this way, we come to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then Caitanya Mahāprabhu's disciples, the six <span class="Italic">Gosvāmīs.</span> Then others, then our Guru Mahārāja. But the same thing we are speaking. <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are not manufacturing anything. That is the <span class="Italic">guru-paramparā</span> system. And if we follow strictly the line of <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> then there is no question of mistake. It is not blind faith. The superiors are following, and we are also following. Of course, there are books, there are everything. <span class="Italic">Śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-pañcarātra-vidhi</span> [<span class="Italic">Brs.</span> 1.2.101]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there. So there is no question of being mistaken. The guide is there, the spiritual master is there. So there is no difficulty. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the best way, follow the <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> Unfortunately, the <span class="Italic">mahājanas,</span> without following <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> everyone is becoming <span class="Italic">mahājana</span> in his own way. And that is being supported, that you manufacture your own way of spiritual progress, that is all right. That is dangerous. That is dangerous. And that is going on now. You can manufacture in your own way. And there are thousands who are coming, manufacturing their own way and spoiling the whole thing. That is the... Otherwise there is no difficulty, <span class="Italic">mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ.</span> We are therefore requesting people that don't be misled. Here is the greatest <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> Kṛṣṇa Himself. You follow His instruction. It is very easy, there is no complication. This is our propaganda. But we don't make any compromise. Why shall I make compromise? If we are presenting the right thing, why shall I make compromise with something wrong? (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Baliye</span>(?). If we are confident that we are presenting the right thing, why shall I make compromise with the wrong thing? (Hindi) No, you are intelligent. You can say if I am saying something wrong. Our culture has been spoiled by interpreting wrongly Kṛṣṇa's words. <span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhūmi, puṇya-bhūmi...</span> still, thousands and millions are there. If there is <span class="Italic">Kumbhamelā,</span> millions of men are coming. Whenever we hold some Kṛṣṇa consciousness meeting, daily, twenty thousand, fifteen thousand, thirty thousand men come. The spirit is there. Unfortunately, that is being artificially depressed. But it cannot be done. The <span class="Italic">puṇya-bhūmi, bhārata-bhūmi,</span> it will go on. But the unfortunate thing is that the clear thing is there and that is being misinterpreted and people are misled. That is the difficulty. [break] (Prabhupāda converses in Hindi with guest)</div>

When they go to preach about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the people say that "We shall think of Kṛṣṇa later on." In India also they say. that "We are now poverty-stricken. Let us first of all become rich, and then we shall think of Kṛṣṇa." They say like that. They are not interested. They think to become rich is more than understanding Kṛṣṇa. That is the position. Therefore they are not interested. They say frankly that "We are not interested, why do you bother us?" they say. "Why do you bother us? Why do you come here to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness?"

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "The Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student, calling him, indirectly, a fool. The Lord said, 'You are talking like a learned man, but you do not know that one who is learned-one who knows what is body and what is soul-does not lament for any stage of the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition.' As it will be explained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both. Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And, because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was posing himself as the body. So he should not consider himself as a learned man. <span class="Italic">Nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. This body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The people are not aware of these things, neither they are interested to know that the soul is more important than the body.

The science is there, but nobody is caring to know it. And still, they are proud of their education. And Kṛṣṇa condemns: <span class="Italic">nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.</span> So they are keeping themselves on the bodily concept of life and posing themselves as <span class="Italic">pandit.</span> A person identifying himself with the body, he's <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ,</span> and he's posing himself as <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> This is the position.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> It is announced. Śrīla Prabhupāda's visit was sufficient.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have been there. Many good Indian population. There is a Indian association there. I have been there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> You are the greatest teacher in recorded history, Prabhupāda, because your movement is so well founded in these books, more so than any religious teacher-Muhammad, Buddha, Jesus Christ. Your movement is perfectly founded even during your own lifetime. All your books are perfectly edited by you. It is truly Lord Caitanya's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Books means solid ground. What we want to preach, it is recorded, not any concocted ideas. There is direction by Rūpa Gosvāmī:</div>
<div class="Verse">śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-<br class="calibre2"/>pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā<br class="calibre2"/>aikāntikī harer bhaktir<br class="calibre2"/>utpātāyaiva kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [<span class="Italic">Brs.</span> 1.2.101]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"> Without the support of <span class="Italic">śruti, smṛti, purāṇa,</span> any religious movement for understanding God is simply disturbance-<span class="Italic">utpātāyaiva kalpate. Utpāt...</span> That is the... It is the version given by... Even Kṛṣṇa, He's God Himself, He's speaking, He's giving reference to the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra: brahma-sūtra-padaiś caiva hetumadbhir viniścitaiḥ</span> [Bg. 13.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> So without reference to the Vedic literature, anything you speak, it has no ground. <span class="Italic">Śruti-pramāṇa,</span> this is Vedic culture, <span class="Italic">śruti-pramāṇa.</span> It must be supported by <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> In <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> you'll find whenever Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, He gives immediately Vedic evidence, <span class="Italic">śruti-pramāṇa.</span> Then it is solid. So we are trying to present this movement with <span class="Italic">śruti-pramāṇa.</span> Our <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> will be finished in sixty volumes, and <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> is already finished in seventeen volumes. So altogether at least we'll have hundred volumes of books, small and big, to give <span class="Italic">śruti-pramāṇa.</span> This is the example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Mrs. Patel has prepared some <span class="Italic">khicuḍi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Khicuḍi?</span> Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> It's here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll take. How many children? You have children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Patel:</span> Two sons and one daughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two sons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Patel:</span> And one daughter. They have gone to India for their holidays now. They wanted to go to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, give everyone little, little <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> You have seen our Bombay temple? We are spending about one <span class="Italic">crore</span> of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Patel:</span> We have seen this Vṛndāvana. Last year we went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There we have spent more than fifty <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Is New Vrindaban temple the main center of the society where everybody should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. New Vrindaban is one of the centers. We have got 103 centers. In Australia also we have got, Melbourne.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Shouldn't we all eat downstairs? Should we have everyone take <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> downstairs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, here. [break] ...Kṛṣṇa practically showing how to live Vṛndāvana life. In Vṛndāvana nobody knows Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nobody knows. But their love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa is intense. That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Premā pumartho mahān.</span> That is required. You simply become an intense lover of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">bas.</span> Your life is successful. It doesn't require any education or... That is the Vṛndāvana residents' life. They did not know what Kṛṣṇa is. But it is, very loving center, all the residents of Vṛndāvana. When Kṛṣṇa's wonderful activities are discussed, Nanda Mahārāja's friend would suggest, "Nanda Mahārāja, your son is wonderful. He must be some demigod. He has come to live with us." They did not know that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. (long pause) How far it is, Afghanistan from here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Actually, it's only one and a half hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only? By car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> No, no, by air. It's about, less than two thousand kilometers. Border is even nearer, but Kabul is less than two thousand kilometers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One Afghan gentleman came. In Afghanistan there are many domiciled Hindus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Yes. Originally we use to live in Peshwar and they used to work and do business in Kabul and they lived in Kabul, but then they stayed on there and became Afghans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After Pakistan. They left Peshwar and went to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> No, they were not living there because there was no passport, there was no need of visa, you could anytime come and go. But after independence of Pakistan, at the same time, they made border, and a country of their own, and then these people stayed on this side, and they became Afghans. There are about, oh, six thousand, five, six thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Homes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> No, five, six thousand people who are Hindus but have Afghan passports. They have got a beautiful temple there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Kabul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Yes, beautiful temple, and there are many Sikhs also there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why not a beautiful temple here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> No objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Patel:</span> Of course not. Because there's already <span class="Italic">Gurukula-dwara</span> (?) here. There shouldn't be any.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> They have no objection, there's no restriction from the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So make a nice temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> First we need the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take that land that you showed me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, we need a piece of land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why piece? Take big land. Make something gorgeous. Kṛṣṇa is not poor. Although He likes to live in the village, but He is Dvārakādhīśa also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Patel:</span> It should be big land for the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Here the land prices are five times what they are in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. Eh? There?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> The price of land here in Tehran is five times what it is in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Highest, most highest in the world, next to probably Tokyo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> The house which you have seen today is worth two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of dollars. In two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of dollars you can have palace in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> But two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> here, you have to have all two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> completely in your hand before you can step into this house. Over there with two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> you step into the house, a palace of one million dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our Los Angeles temple, what we paid? Dayānanda, you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> It was two twenty-five, I think. 225,000 dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 225,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> 225,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> 225,000. But it must be a gorgeous place. Beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> And what was the downpayment for the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I paid fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Fifty thousand. Here the downpayment means the total payment. You have to pay everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Patel:</span> And land is so small, must be very small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> We expect that in one or two years' time the prices of land will come back to normal, or at least there will be some place available out of town at a reasonable price. When that happens, I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> I don't think that will happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Patel:</span> No, it won't happen. Price will never become down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Now, you know, people are taking the advantage. One who is selling now, he's going to America. He said "Let me collect this two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of dollars, go and buy in America."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They, in America, they immigration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> He must have taken immigration. His family is going to America. His son and daughter must be there. All Iranians have sons or daughters in America or Europe. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Reason is because from the last fifty years the education was a big problem here. And the government needed people to get educated. So they gave lot of facilities that people should send their children out to get educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foreign education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Yes. So everybody who could have some money if he could afford it, he sent his children to America, London, Paris, Germany. Berne, even Switzerland, but they are full in Germany, they are full in London, they are full in America. They are the four places where everybody... In London you walk everywhere on the street and you can hear...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you are going? Thank you very much. <span class="Italic">Utsāhān dhairyāt...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> So we are here, if we work hard and try to please Kṛṣṇa, then there we will get a temple. Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived in New York with only eight dollars? Forty dollars? How many dollars you had when you arrived in New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seven dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> Seven dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> I think you got that from selling <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that extra. I brought from India seven dollars. At that time the exchange was four rupees, eight annas. So they would not allow to take more than forty rupees. That is sufficient. So I wanted to sell one set of books to the captain, Mr. Pandiya. So he gave me twenty dollars in exchange of three books. I was confident Kṛṣṇa was there seven dollars. (end)</div>
