<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the size of the body has changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The size has changed. It has grown, increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It looks different, completely... It looks different. There is no similarity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no similarity. Why the child... There was no mustaches. Why you have mustaches? How you can say "The same body"? You shall have to give your own argument. Child had no mustaches; you have got now mustaches. How you can say the same body? The child had no sex desire; now you have got sex desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They would say all these things are dormant within the child's body, and now they are coming out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we also say, but that body not... That "dormant" means dormant in the soul, not in the body. That is the knowledge. Dormant it is, but dormant in the soul, not in the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have to admit that it's a different body because if the body is simply made of food and they are eating so much and evacuating so much, then it has to be a different body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is different body, undoubtedly. If they foolishly argue, that is different thing. Therefore rascal. Their argument has no value. How you can be the same body? So many changes. The body is changed. (to Indian man:) What is that? It was not <span class="Italic">garam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> No, <span class="Italic">garam</span> not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this argument, how he can refute, that he has died twenty-two years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, he can also say that he has lived twenty-two years, because he has no perception of any life before that time. He can't remember living before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "Before, I was not alive. Now I am alive, so I have lived for twenty-two years. Before, I was dead; I was not alive. Now I am alive, so I've been alive for twenty-two years."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So before, you were not alive. Then how your life came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The combination of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it. Again foolishness. These rascals... (laughs) Then, if you can create life, then where is the question of dead body? You create again. Give life again. If you are so competent that you can give life, combination, then this dead body is there. You bring chemicals and inject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The same chemicals are there, too. The same chemicals, living body, dead body-five minutes before, five after-is the same chemicals. But they can't explain why there is such a drastic difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that same chemical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the living body, two minutes before death and two minutes after...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that? Name that, what is that chemical. Then bring it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Let him try and make life. Not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you know the chemical, then you bring it. Chemical is available. Why this is dead? What they will answer? What this chemical is wanting, that it is dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, we may not know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, you rascal, why you are talking? You do not know. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But, then, neither do you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You can say soul, but you don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. But you cannot answer my question; therefore you are more rascal than me. You cannot answer. Your... You are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You have the position. He's in a position. He cannot answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You say that chemical is missing. I say what is that chemical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but the chemical is not missing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The same chemical is there. Two minutes before death and two minutes after death, the body chemistry has not changed so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. What is that missing that it is dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can't answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are fool. You cannot answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because it's not a question of chemical. Actually they don't know what life is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are foolish. Therefore he has to take knowledge from Kṛṣṇa: <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā...</span> "Within this body there is soul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You say there's a soul, but we've never seen a soul. It may be your imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not see. You have not seen your forefather. That does not mean... This is all bad argument. Why do you believe? Your eyes are so imperfect; still, you say, "I did not see. I want to see." What is the value of your eyes? You see the sun globe-a small disc. But is it so? Then how do you know that it is so big?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> By hearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By hearing. That is important, not by seeing. Therefore <span class="Italic">śruti, Veda,</span> is important, not your eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> When people die, though, there is usually some cause. Like they have a heart attack or they get hit by a car or some disease. So that death is caused by the disease...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not the cause. That is the effect. You foolish, do not know. You are taking it, cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, when you get hit by a car, that's a cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like one man becomes insolvent, loses everything. So he said that "I had no money. Therefore I become insolvent." But that is not the fact. He could not manage; therefore there was scarcity of money and he became failure. So that is effect. On account of his bad management, he came to a position that he could not pay to his creditor, and his business is failure. So that insolvency is not the cause. It is the effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhīṣma was able to remain in his body even on a bed of arrows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when you are going to die, these are the... On account of imminent death, these are the effects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But that means that the body breaks down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The body breaks down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At a certain period it will break.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So that is the cause, the body breaking down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you say heart failure is the cause. No. The body is breaking; therefore heart failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So death means the body breaks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all your answer... You say the heart failure is the cause. The man is dying. I say that because the man is dying, the heart is failure. So heart failure is not the cause. It is the effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's very difficult...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because his <span class="Italic">karma</span> in that body is running out, he has to leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But if I can get some machine that will make the heart keep on beating, then the man won't die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That you are failure. You have got so many machines. You go on, keeping the heart going on. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Finally they just pull out the plug. The doctor kicks the plug one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> At the present moment, I was reading, there is one girl in America, New Jersey, teenage girl. And for some unknown reason she went to sleep one night, and in the morning she did not wake up. So they then rushed her to the hospital, and they have an artificial machine that is keeping her alive, and this has been going on for one month. All of her bodily functions are becoming more and more diminished, but still, by this machine, she is alive. Now this has gone on for one month. So now they don't know what to do with her. Should they keep her like this, just running on the machine, or should they stop the machine and then she will die? This is a big legal problem. They don't know what... If they stop the machine, they'll be accused of manslaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some Catholic priest said that better to let her die, because this is God's way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he has to accept the God's way and give up the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But in a situation like that, isn't it more valuable to preserve human life because there's the chance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a chance that somehow or another, they might be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should you take the chance? You are perplexed with overpopulation. And why you want to stay? One side, you are perplexed with overpopulation. Let him die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they can use the argument that you're saying that human life is simply for Kṛṣṇa consciousness or God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, from his argument, why should you try to keep it? Let him die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They are afraid of death. No one wants to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are afraid someone will take them off the machine, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> We want to live as long as we can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you have to accept that your killing child, abortion, that is sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> It's easier for the mind to accept what is apparent to the senses. For example, to accept that I am this body is easier for my mind than to accept a philosophy which you say that we are not this body. That is very difficult for my mind to accept, whereas I can accept very immediately that I am this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is difficult, therefore you are a fool. That proves that you are a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Why should I strive for something so difficult, such a philosophical understanding, when I can live very happily with this body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But because you do not want to die. You want happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> So I can enjoy this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot. That is the difficulty. You want, but you cannot. You want. That I know. But you cannot do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You never see happy people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their ignorance. They are accepting unhappiness as happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, in this world there has to be some unhappiness and there has to be some happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are trying to give you happiness only, no unhappiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But that's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That's artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you say, but we know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> We cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot see, but you will see if you be trained up. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But it is easier for us to remain here and enjoy a little bit and accept a little suffering, accept this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa said that "<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> should be discussed amongst My devotees, not amongst the rascals." It will be waste of time. <span class="Italic">Ya imaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati.</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati<br class="calibre2"/>bhaktiṁ mayi paraṁ kṛtvā<br class="calibre2"/>mām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg 18.68]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not to the fools and rascals. So first of all, to give them chance, let them come to the temple, take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> hear <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> offer obeisances by imitating others. In this way, when they become little devotee, then instruct. Otherwise it will be useless. You'll waste your time by arguing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have given the example that the field has to be plowed before the seed is sown, cultivated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The mind has to want that higher taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> So this process... Bring the... Invite them. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, dance, give them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Everyone will take part in this way, not immediately instructing that "You are not this body; you are soul." He will not be able to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> It's too difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore this process is recommended. Caitanya Mahāprabhu argued with Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, not with ordinary public. Ordinary public-"Go on chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and dancing." Never argued, neither He discussed <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> For ordinary public-four hours' <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> chanting and dancing, <span class="Italic">bas.</span> And then give them sufficient <span class="Italic">prasādam:</span> "Take <span class="Italic">prasāda</span>." This process... Because unless he has got little <span class="Italic">śraddhā,</span> he will simply put some false argument and waste your time. Not in the beginning. <span class="Italic">Mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati.</span> First of all create him a devotee a little. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa-<span class="Italic">harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]-only. Because this is <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga,</span> people are so fallen, so downtrodden, so rascal, cats and dogs. It is very difficult. But this process-chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> giving them chance to hear it and take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>-that will cure. And that is easily accepted by anyone. It doesn't matter what he is. Anyone will accept. To chant and dance and take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>-no one will disagree. So this is the process. When they come to the temple... Just like these boys. You are offering obeisances; they are also offering. But that will go to their credit, to become <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> This process should be adopted. Not in the beginning, but in the beginning give them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And try to sell some book. You pay something. That means he is giving some service, the hard-earned money. That will also go to his credit. And then, when he'll concerned that "I have paid for it. Let me see what this nonsense has written. All right. Read." And that will also convince him. This is the way. He'll keep this body, book, and show some friend, so the infection will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> We can see in some of our boys in Kenya. Practically they have no education and very little intelligence, but still, they are doing everything. They're falling down. They are offering all the prayers. They are taking <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They are chanting. They are doing everything, even they don't have the intelligence to understand why.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You said that no chemical is missing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No chemical difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why it is dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The body is dead? Well, they haven't been able to determine that yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they are rascals. There is no argument because you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They say "fate." They say "There is fate."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faith we have got, but you have no faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Not faith. Fate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that fate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Predetermined, predestined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who made it, the predestination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Higher controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> Then you have to accept some higher authority, God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But he is not a person. He is not a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. That is another thing. That is another question. But you have to accept some superior authority. As soon as you accept fate, destiny, then you have to accept superior authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They also say "nature." They say "by nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it... Whatever it may be. You have to accept some superior authority. That means you are not independent. You are under the control of the superior authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Time. Time is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. You call by any name. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> These bodies are a reaction, effect, isn't it? These bodies are an effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then death also must be some effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who has made this law, cause and effect? Some way or other, you have to accept that you are not independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Their arguments are so foolish, it's hard to think of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> they have been described. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are being kicked, punished; still, he says, "Oh, I don't care for anybody." I kick on your face. "Yes, I don't care for you." Like that. This is their argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But because everything in this world appears to be disordered, it is difficult to accept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The world is not in disorder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But it appears to be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Man makes order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Man makes order?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is... Your idea is that he conceives of the order. But actually there is no order, but he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When there is cyclone, man can stop?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> For example this beach is all disorder. There is so much rubbish there. There is no order to this world. So how can there be any higher authority...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what you can do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> I cannot accept that there is a higher authority when everything is simply disorganized. These trees are broken, the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is organized. It is organized. For thousands of years the sea is there, the beach is there. So sea cannot come here. This is order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But the line of the beach is all crooked and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your imperfect vision. It is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> People think, "Straight and corners, that is very nice. If everything has corners..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your concoction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Like a building, straight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if you think that "Why keep to the left? Why not right?" You think like that, but that is ordered by the superior. You can think in your own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Because it appears that way to my senses, therefore I think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is authority. You can think like anything, but it will not be done according to your desire. It will be done by the authority's desire. That is authority. You cannot dictate the authority that "You do like this." That is not authority. You think any way; that is your business. But authority will do in their own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually, nobody cares about philosophy. Nobody follows philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He cares for death. That is the ultimate philosophy, that they have to die. Say, "I don't care for this order. I'll not die." Then your disobedience is all right. But you have to die. You have to become old man. How you can disobey?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> So if death is imminent, then I should simply try to enjoy myself as long as I can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Enjoy. What is that enjoyment if you are going to die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's so incredible how crazy everything is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, at least before I die, I can get as much pleasure as I can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody can, if he is actually afraid of death. Suppose if you are given a beautiful woman-"Enjoy, and as soon as you come out I will shoot you." (laughter) Will you enjoy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a great example. That example would change the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference between a man of knowledge and a fool. Man of knowledge, that is that he knows he has to die. "But I don't wish to die. So what is the solution?" That is man of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Sometimes they say "Well, why worry about death? It's gotta happen anyway, so why should we worry?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you... You... Because you are rascal number one, you don't worry, but that is the psychology. This is the example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But I want to enjoy right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose that you enjoy this woman for few minutes. Then you will be shot down. Then will you be able to enjoy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Actually they do that. When some man is to be executed in the prison they give him one woman the night before as a special consolation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They finish him off completely. They ruin him. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But death is very far away from me. I am only thirty years old. I don't have to worry about death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the guarantee that you will live thirty-one years? What is the guarantee that you will live thirty-one years? There is no guarantee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But everyone else around me appears to be having fun and enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can use this argument though, Prabhupāda. I've heard it before, that "So God has placed us in this world. Okay, there is God, and He has placed us in this world, and He has created the world also, and He has made these things very, very enjoyable, sex life, and this and that. So why not enjoy if God has created it?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. That is foolishness. It is not enjoyable. That is... If a criminal says, "The prisonhouse is very enjoyable," it is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But all the travel brochures and the advertisements, they say it's nice here. All the advertising and travel brochures, they say it is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him say, but prisonhouse, is it nice? That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But everyone else says it's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone? I don't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> You are the only one who says it is not nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am the only intelligent person. (laughter) That's a fact. <span class="Italic">Mūḍho nābhijānāti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām: [Bg. </span>7.23] "Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary." So does this mean that these less intelligent people who are simply interested in temporary benefit... Even they don't worship demigods per se, it could be anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Demigods... Yes. Just like one who is trying to get some good service. So they are worshiping this boss, that boss. That is also demigod, because without flattering some boss he cannot get some good job; without flattering the voters he cannot get the ministership. That is demigod worship. They have to flatter somebody. Why this Ram Gulab has gone to...? He has to flatter there. This is going on. The big bosses in the United Nation, they are demigods, supposed to be. He thinks, "If I flatter them, then I will be able to keep my position." But he does not think that this position will be lost after some years. <span class="Italic">Tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām.</span> He has forgotten his eternal life, Kṛṣṇa, and he is flattering these demigods. That's all. What he will gain? He will die. That's all. At the time of death what these United Nation leaders will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But we can improve the standard for future generations, for our children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you improve your own condition; then think of future generation. You are going to hell and thinking of future generation. You are going to die, and you are thinking of future generation. Who is your future generation? That is another foolishness. This is asuric civilization. Asuric civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Hope against hope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hope, that is also foolishness. Apart from future generation, you have got sons. So you are taking very great care. Does it mean that his life is guaranteed? So what you can do? You cannot do anything for your present generation, what to speak of future generation. You cannot do. Suppose your son is sick. As father, you have given first-class medicine, first-class physician. Does it guarantee that he will live? Then what can you do? Is it in your control that your son will live because you have given good physician, good medicine? Is it guarantee that your son will live? Then what can you do? You cannot do anything for your present generation, and you are thinking of future generation, which you do not know, who is your future generation. At the present moment you know this is your generation, you cannot do anything, and you are thinking of future generation. How foolish you are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Well, we may have to accept the laws of nature, but at least we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore, what is the meaning of taking care of future generation or this generation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> At least we can make it comfortable in this world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is not possible. You have already given good medicine, good physician. And why he is dying? You cannot do anything. That is your position. You may try to do, but that is futile. Ultimate is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> So by giving him medicine, maybe I can give him a better chance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Maybe" can be, but it is not guaranteed. You cannot do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But at least I should try.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Try. Foolishly you try whatever you like. That is another thing. But it is not under your control. You can try. That is your... Of course, you must try as a dutiful father, but you should know that you cannot take any guarantee or do anything, good or bad. That you have already said, "the destiny." That is prominent. That is prominent, not you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The tendency of the humans...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do the best to train your child to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is in your power. That you can do. That is the best service, not anything else. That is not possible. If you become yourself Kṛṣṇa conscious, and if you try to make your son Kṛṣṇa conscious, that you can do. And that is the duty, real duty. Other things, you cannot do anything. That is destiny. And if you make him Kṛṣṇa conscious, then destiny can also be changed. This is the concession of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Destiny also can be changed. <span class="Italic">Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām [Bs. </span>5.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his <span class="Italic">karma</span> is also changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Is that <span class="Italic">karma</span> dovetailed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> It's still there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still can be changed by <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Just like one man is condemned to death. Nobody can change it, but the king can change it. Only by the mercy of king he can be saved, not otherwise. Even the judge who has punished him, he cannot do it. Whatever is ordered, there is order. He cannot change it. Similarly, if you become devotee, then your destiny can be changed. A devotee never is anxious to change his destiny. That is devotee's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like Mahārāja Parīkṣit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But if his destiny takes him away from Kṛṣṇa, then he is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's desire. If Kṛṣṇa desires, He can do anything. So a devotee does not interfere with Kṛṣṇa's desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We know that Kṛṣṇa desires everyone to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is... Kṛṣṇa says. That is His desire. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān pa..., mām ekāṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Kṛṣṇa is not causing everyone to forget Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Kṛṣṇa's desire is open to everyone. We don't accept it. That is our obstinacy. Kṛṣṇa says "There is soul." We do not say. "No, there is no soul." This is our position. Kṛṣṇa says, "Within this body there is soul," and we don't accept. We'll argue. This is our position. He is giving direct instruction, "Yes, there is soul," but we don't accept. Disobedient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But if Kṛṣṇa knows that we will suffer in this material world, why does He let us go away from Him? Why doesn't He keep us there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> If Kṛṣṇa knows that we will suffer here in this material world if we come here, why does He let us go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the thief goes to the prisonhouse? He knows that "If I go to the prisonhouse, I will be put into distress."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But the government is not strong enough to force him not to go, not to steal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why government is not strong enough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The government doesn't have the power to control everyone. But Kṛṣṇa can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Even if he's strong enough, you disobey. The government has made so many things that you cannot steal, the iron chest, but still, you are clever enough that you do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The independence is there. Sometimes people ask, Prabhupāda, that if the spiritual world is <span class="Italic">ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">,</span> full of bliss, then how is it that, somehow or another, we've left that blissful situation and come into this hellish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This argument we have talked many times. Everyone knows that out of prisonhouse freedom is there. Why he goes to the prisonhouse? Everyone knows it. Why does he go to the prisonhouse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not by choice. He is placed there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller. If He wanted to check us from going there, He could check us from going into the prison, from offending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Kṛṣṇa has given you independence. So you are.... By mentality, you have to suffer. Suppose if a child wants to do something, play, if you check it, check it, then he will go mad. Just like mother Yasoda was showing stick to Kṛṣṇa, and when Kṛṣṇa became so much afraid, he (she) became immediately anxious: "Oh, Kṛṣṇa has too much anxiety. He may fall sick." So immediately throw away. So this is father-mother's affection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> So actually it is Kṛṣṇa's mercy that He allows us to come here, free ourselves from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. He has given you little freedom. He doesn't want to take your freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You gave two examples in Los Angeles about the master, big master, like president of DuPont walking his dog. The president of DuPont is walking his dog in Central Park. The dog makes him go this way and this way and this way. And you said we are just passing stool and urine in the material world, and Kṛṣṇa is just letting us run here and there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Anumantā.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">anumantā, upadraṣṭā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> in one of your purports you gave the example of Paramātmā being compared to when there is a circus in a village the government sends one inspector to watch over the activities. Then, when the circus goes, he is no longer there. Could you explain it? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, if Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of pleasure, then what does He need us for? If Kṛṣṇa is all blissful, then what... We're so, it seems, incapable of pleasing Kṛṣṇa. He is so magnanimous. What does He need us for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not ask for Himself. For you. If you come to Kṛṣṇa and enjoy with Him, that is your good. He is self-sufficient. He doesn't require.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes, Prabhupāda, when they see your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> they say, "Oh, it is too big for me to read." They don't know that the purport.... They've never read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say that bring them, let them chant and dance and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That, everyone will hear, agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> One who does that, he is preaching? One who arranges for chanting and dancing and taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> that is as good as preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇam, kīrtanam, arcanam</span>-anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> These festival programs are very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (pause) You have to spend or waste gallons of blood before you can convert a person to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is so difficult task.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> You have to spend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gallons of blood, waste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> In what way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By talking with him, with the rascal and foolish. You tax your brain and spoil your energy, blood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Spend so much food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> So we should do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless you are not a preacher. You should be prepared. Yes. They cuts, sacrifices life, what to speak of wasting blood. Wasting life. This is preacher. Then he is recognized by Kṛṣṇa: "He has done so much for Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa will give more and more energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is going to die for Kṛṣṇa, and therefore he is recognized. <span class="Italic">Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> You become immediately very dear to Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They have mentioned that there is no purport for this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already explained. Anyone who is preaching...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You are the purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Simply people are trying to find out ways that they don't have to surrender to perfect knowledge. They can go on enjoying in the material world.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think you should preach every breakfast. Your appetite is very good.</div>
