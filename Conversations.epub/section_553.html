<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Worshiping the dead bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> There's a pathway up here that goes up... Śrīla Prabhupāda? Sometimes when we are speaking, people say, in the questions they say, "Why do you say this is a science? It seems that this must be belief. Because science..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your so-called science is also belief. You believe in one way, we believe in another way. And if you call it science, then it is also science. If you call your belief as science, then why shall I not call my belief as science? Your is also belief. You have never gone to the moon, and you are talking of so many things about moon. That is your belief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But they say with science they can prove so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can also prove. You cannot prove. Just like you say the life is made of chemicals. You prove it. Take chemicals and make a life, then it is true. Otherwise it is a humbug. Why do you say like that, that life is made of chemicals? You cannot prove it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> I do not say that life is made of chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They say. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, these rascals say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But they say they can prove that there are chemicals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You prove it. You take the chemicals and prove-produce life. Why do you talk nonsense? First of all prove. You did not produce a life, even an ant, in the laboratory, and still you say life is a combination of chemicals. Why do you say like that? Challenge them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> We cannot see souls, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It appears that matter comes from matter, or life comes from matter. We cannot see the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot see, but you can perceive. If life comes from matter, then when there is a dead body, put matter and make it alive. Or put chemicals. Chemical is also matter. Make him alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> We made some, um, um...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, first of all this is my challenge: that here is a dead body, so bring some chemicals. Just like a motorcar stopped for want of chemical, petrol. So you bring petrol and it will be started. Similarly, you bring some chemical and start it again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, that will require some time to find the chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you fool. You are talking nonsenses. You do not know what is that chemical. You prove yourself a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, we accept that we don't know, but we are trying to learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if you don't know, why do you talk nonsense? First of all you know, then talk. That is science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But the way we built this civilization and technology...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not civilization. It is animal. You are eating meat, and you are civilized? The tigers eat meat, the dogs eat meat. A human being, why should he eat meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But there are so many wonderful things taking place, brain transplants, and so many other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You are not civilized so long you are eating meat. You are dogs and cats and tigers, that's all. The tiger may be a very strong animal, but it is not to be called that he is civilized. Nobody will say the tiger is civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But we have made airplanes and cars, and if we had only waited until we knew, we never could have made it. But by trying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. You have made some technical advancement. That does not mean you are civilized. Civilized means the Aryans. They know what is the soul. That is civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But we have seen in the Eastern countries where the people don't eat meat, they are at the same time very primitive. Very uncivilized, like savages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They don't have enough food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No technology, no education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you have plundered them for the last two thousand years. You rascals, rogues, you have plundered. You have taken all their money, all their jewels, all their gold, and made British Museum. (laughter) It is due to you. (noise in background) What is the dog? Some dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh, that is the siren. You mean the siren?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Some bird.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh, yeah. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> we claim that it is a fact scientifically that Kṛṣṇa appeared on earth and so many things. But actually isn't it because we believe that the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is true that we think it is scientific? Because we believe it. But someone else would say, "I don't believe it, so for me it's not scientific."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is not scientific? If <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">,</span> by eating sufficient grains, the living entity become flourished. So, can you deny it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That must be true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is true. If you think it properly, you'll find it is all true. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ: [Bg. </span>4.13] "By Me, the four divisions of human soceity are made." The most intelligent class, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> who knows the soul, God, etc., by their character, by their behavior. That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class. This is the most perfect way of keeping society. Unless there is a class which is very intelligent who know what is God, what is soul, then what is the civilization? Simply motorcar drivers? Is that civilization? Where is the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> This is not civilization. Simply some artisans and workers, motorcar drivers, mill workers, where is civilized man, who knows God, who knows soul, who knows how to conduct the human society to the perfection? Where is that man? It is not civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But we have philosophers and poets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all loafer class. They have no information of the soul. They are studying in the dead matter, that's all. Freud and others, Darwin. What do they know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> There are also so many priests and rabbis, the Pope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what do they know about the soul, about God? First thing is that there is a supreme authority. You are not independent. So if you do not know who is that supreme authority, what is the value of your knowledge? You have to accept there is a supreme authority, because you are not independent. But you do not know. Just like a rascal, he does not know about the government. What kind of man he is? He's a rascal. A civilized man means he knows what is government, what is the history of government. That is civilized. And if he doesn't know what is government, he is simply living there, he's a third class man. So you have to accept there is a government of the whole universal affair, but you do not know it. Then you are third-class man. You are not human being; you are animal. Animal does not know. This is the proof that you are animal, you are not human being. A human being, at least a class of man there must be<span class="Italic">-brāhmaṇa. Brāhma jānāti iti brāhmaṇaḥ,</span> one who knows how things are going on. We know that. We Kṛṣṇa conscious people, we know. Therefore we are civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was written five thousand years ago, so it doesn't pertain to today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was not written. It was there. Then you do not read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Why you are speaking like that? You know <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> You have not studied <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is a disgrace for you. You have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> A little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He says yes, a little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you do not know. Why he says that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was written five thousand years ago? Why do you say like that? You do not know. It was first spoken forty millions of years ago. <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham...</span> What kind of realization of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you do not know? I am accusing you because you are student of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. How you do not know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I think he was posing as a materialist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But one who does not know, why is he saying that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was written five thousand years ago? He does not know. That is my point. If you had known then you would not have said like that, foolishly, that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was spoken five thousand years ago. It is <span class="Italic">avyayam,</span> it is eternally there. It is eternally there. <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">. Avyayam</span> means which is never under deterioration. It is eternally existing. That is <span class="Italic">avyayam.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> soul, <span class="Italic">avyayam.</span> There is no deterioration. It is there. So forty millions of years ago once it was spoken, but in due course of time it is now lost; therefore I am speaking it again to you. You did not read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said there? How do you say it was written five thousand years ago? It is already there. It was first spoken forty millions of years ago, now it is lost. The material world is like that. One thing is lost sometimes. Therefore I am speaking to you. And why are you speaking to me? Because you are my devotee. This is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That means only the devotees can understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and it is always existing, and because it is now lost... Just like we are putting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> why am I stressing so much? It is lost. By the so-called Gandhis and Dr. Radhakrishnan, they have made it lost. Therefore we are stressing. The thing is there. We are simply trying to revive it again. It is not that it is the beginning. No. It is already there. But these rascals have made it lost. People do not understand it, do not follow it, that is the difficulty. So we are trying to revive it again. It is revival of the whole teaching. Permanent teaching. Permanent beneficial instruction. Now it is lost. Which way shall we go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> Straight ahead, Śrīla Prabhupāda, there is another path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is another path?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Another footpath, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This road is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which way? This way or that way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> This way is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The sun is this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is not that, five thousand years ago, not like that. Just like you cannot say the sun is now coming. It is there. It is there always. You are seeing now. They used to think like that-at night the sun is dead. These rascals. And they are advanced. They used to think that this earth is square. (laughing) And they are advanced. They are changing their opinion daily. That is their scientific knowledge. Why should they change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They say this means they are discovering the truth, step by step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you do not know the truth. That is a fact. You do not know-simply speculating. You are accepting some spot-this is truth. And after some days, "No, no, this is not truth, <span class="Italic">this</span> is truth." This is your position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Many of the scientific textbooks that were written twenty years ago are all outdated. Can't use them any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Useless. So this scientific at the present moment, after twenty years they'll be useless. This is your scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But at least what we know now is more true than what we knew before. And if we keep trying we'll know more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that means you are always in ignorance. This means that you are always in ignorance. And Kṛṣṇa does not say like that. Kṛṣṇa says the same thing I am speaking to you again. That means we are not in ignorance. We may forget something, but the truth is always the same. But you are making, manufacturing, discovering truth. That means you do not know what is truth. You should answer like that. That you are all rascals. You do not know what is truth; therefore you are discovering truth. Truth is never discovered. It is already there. But you do not know what is that truth. That is credit that you are making advance towards truth, but you do not know what is truth. That is a fact. Is it clear? Making discoveries means you do not know what is truth. But it is good credit for you that you are trying to advance. That we agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So eventually if we keep advancing like this we'll understand the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No you'll never advance. Your advance is so slow and foolish that you cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But some Indian history professors say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not talking of Indian history, we are talking on the truth. We never say it is Indian truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has been presented in so many ways also, and now we are saying it is another way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that "I am showing you the way how to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You have to accept that." Not so many ways. Only that way. That I have explained in the Preface, that when you have to take a medicine, you have to take the direction: dose, such and such. Not that so many ways doses are prescribed. According to the prescription you have to take. Otherwise you will waste your time. Now they have wasted so many plates. What is the value of this? (referring to memorial plates on trees.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūtejya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What benefit is there? A soldier has died. So what is the use of having a tree, having a plate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> This will make us remember how much our countrymen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What benefit is there by remembering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well the family feels honored that there is a tree here for a son of their's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What benefit do they derive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, they can come and see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they think that man who has died is still there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Next time when there is a war, then they will feel more inclined to fight, knowing that there may be a tree for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It means, this is government deceiving. The man is not there. And even if he is there, suppose the soldier after dying for his country has become a tree, is it a very good reward? (laughter) How foolishly they are thinking. We have to point out their foolishness. That is our business. They are working very hard, undoubtedly, but they are working foolishly. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> The result is simply they are becoming tired. That's all. Because they are not working intelligently, like monkey, he is busy all day. What is the value of your busy? You'll find the monkey is never sitting idle. He's always busy, "eḥ, eh, eh." (imitating monkey) So what is the result of that busyness? He's a monkey. And they claim to be coming from monkey, these rascals. So we can see that your monkey's quality is already there. (laughter) You have not improved more than monkey, because you are working uselessly. They are theorizing that they have come from monkey, and as soon as you say that you are monkey, they become angry. Just see. They are claiming that we are coming from monkey. And if you say you are monkey, no better than monkey, then they are angry. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's because we've advanced from the monkey stage up to the human stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not advanced. If you are uselessly working, then you are monkey. Monkey is busy, but useless. There is no value. What is the value of your working? You cannot make a solution of the problem that you are dying. Then what is the use of your working? You do not like to die. Why you are dying? You are keeping memory of him because you wanted that he should not have died. That is your desire. You do not like to die. So where is the solution of your death? You might open many hospitals, but where is the solution of disease, that there should be no more disease? That you cannot do. Therefore your so-called scientific research, working hard day and night, is all monkeys' business. Useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But we are seeing that even the spiritualists get old and die also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. We are not talking of this body. We are talking of the soul. We say that soul transmigrates. So, instead of transmigrating to another this perishable body, we are transmigrating to the eternal body. That is our business. We are making solution. But you do not know. You are simply working like monkey, uselessly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But we haven't seen that anyone has got...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can see? You cannot see. You do not believe in transmigration. So how can you see? <span class="Italic">Paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣā.</span> When you will have the eyes to see-knowledge-then you'll see. Now you are monkey, how you can see? A monkey cannot see. <span class="Italic">Paśyanti jñāna cakṣuṣa.</span> Just like our men in India, they know I have come to Australia. But he's not seeing by his eyes. He knows the arrangement was made, they purchased ticket, and they went to the airport. And they are confident. They are sending letters here. Has he come with me to see? How he knows? That I have come here, how he knows? He has not seen that I have come here. But how he knows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> By hearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means there are other sources of understanding-not only the eyes. The rascals do not know. They want to <span class="Italic">see.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Of course a person can never be completely sure...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, <span class="Italic">jñāna cakṣuṣa.</span> You can see with knowledge how this man is being transferred to the eternal life. But you have no such knowledge! You are monkey. A monkey cannot see, a monkey cannot understand. Suppose there is a dog at my house. He does not understand how I have come here, because he has no knowledge. So seeing means knowledge. Seeing, not the eyes. He wants to see by the eyes. He's a monkey. That's all. He's a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But first we have to believe it, and then we can see it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of belief. It is a fact. It is a fact in this way, that Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">-</span>that's all. You have to see through Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is perfect. Kṛṣṇa says that a such and such person devotee, after giving up this body, he does not accept. That is seeing. Kṛṣṇa says and you see. Just like you believe me. A child believes the father. Similarly, if the authority is there, then you see by his word, that's all. That is knowledge. Seeing by perfect knowledge-that is seeing. Not by endeavoring with these imperfect senses. That is not knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But in this modern age...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Modern age means all rascals and fools. So we haven't got to follow the rascals and fools. You have to follow the most perfect, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The problem is that everyone is cheating. Everyone is presenting some knowledge of this or that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we have accepted Kṛṣṇa, who will not cheat. You are cheater, therefore you are believing cheaters. We do not cheat, and we accept a person who does not cheat. That is the difference between you and me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> But we were all cheaters before we came to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So how is it that we're not accepting a cheater? How is it that we cheaters have accepted some knowledge from you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because you are speaking what Kṛṣṇa said. He is not cheater. He is God. I am talking to you, but not my own knowledge. I am presenting to you what Kṛṣṇa said. That's all. Therefore I am not cheater. I might have been a cheater, but since I am talking only the words of Kṛṣṇa, since then I am not cheater. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">vedāhaṁ samatītāni</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 7.26]<span class="Italic">,</span> "I know past, present and future." Therefore He is not cheater. But so far we are concerned, we do not know what was the past and what is future. And we do not know perfectly the present also. And if we speak something, then we are cheater. That is cheating. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that don't hear the cheaters and don't try to cheat others. Be honest, and hear from the authority. This is Kṛṣṇa. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is, that don't hear the cheaters and don't try to cheat others. Be honest and hear from the authorities. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Why is it that some people, when they hear about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they take it, and some do not. And still, after that, some of those who take it, they stay, and some who take it take it for some time and then they fail?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is fortunate and unfortunate. Just like one inherits father's property. Many millions of dollars, and he has become a poor man by his misusing the money. Like that. He is unfortunate. He got the money, but he could not utilize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadharma:</span> Does fortune mean it's the mercy of Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa's mercy is always there. It is your misuse of free will. You are given the opportunity-that is fortune. But you do not accept the fortune. That is your misfortune. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛita.</span> Lord Caitanya said, <span class="Italic">ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.151]<span class="Italic">. Kono</span>-some fortunate man can accept it. Because mostly they are unfortunate. Just see, throughout the whole of Europe and America we are making propaganda. How many students have come? A very insignificant number, although they have come. They are fortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Sometimes we see that a devotee may be very sincere, but at the same time he becomes weak somehow, and he falls down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even if he falls down, still he is fortunate, because the injection is there. It will act, some day or another. Still he is fortunate. As fortunate man he took it, but he fell down. That does not mean he's unfortunate. Still he's fortunate, because the poison is already there. It will develop. That is called <span class="Italic">ajñāta sukṛti.</span> Therefore he is not loser. He continues to be fortunate. It will take some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> So he became weak because he misused his individual will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He misused the instruction of his spiritual master. Therefore he became unfortunate, or he fell down. (pause) This is botanical garden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The sign says parking for botanic gardens. But I'm not acquainted with it. (pause) I don't know. It says, "Cetenniary. August 22, 1947." Perhaps its name is on the other side. (pause) Is there going to be a world war very soon? We heard there would be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Then it will be a very different situation for preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your preaching will not be stopped. It will go on. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He's bringing the car. He went back. He'll bring it around. (reading sign) "The Tree Society originated the idea of placing this <span class="Italic">kadi</span> log in King's Park. The log, normally destined for milling, was provided and brought by Booning Brothers P.T. Limited from their Darling River sawmilling area. The following transporting and placing in position of this great log from over 200 miles from the depths of the forest, with each of the three sections borne on a 200 horsepower motor truck, was a major engineering feat and a tribute to the spirit of western Australian timber men. With the approval and assistance of the King's Park board, the actual placing of the log in King's Park by 25 June, 1958, was contributed to by Hume Pipe Co., Aaron Brothers B.P. Australia Ltd, the Forests Department and other government departments. The completion of the project was a fine example of community effort."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It weighs a hundred and ten tons. And it's 363 years old, this log. They say it grew that long. In America we have some redwood trees in California they say are many thousands of years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> This is a type of eucalyptus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It says <span class="Italic">Eucalyptus diversicol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">kiṁ taromana jīvanti.</span> You want to prolong your life. The trees-they do not prolong their life? So if you prolong your life, does it mean that you are better than a tree? <span class="Italic">Kim taromana jīvanti.</span> If prolonging life is your mission, the trees automatically do that without any scientific knowledge. Then what is the value of your science? <span class="Italic">Kim taromana jīvanti.</span> Do they not live for thousands of years? What is the value of such living? If the tree is living, standing for 10,000 years, then what is the value of this 10,000 years? So if you live like a tree, without any benefit, then what is the value of your life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadharma:</span> Some people say that trees may be very happy. How do we know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want to become happy like that, be. Stand up. Stand up on the bench and laugh-be happy. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But they say we are humans; we can enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What enjoy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Television, cinema, dancing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the dogs also dance and enjoy. The monkeys also dance and enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But these animals, they're not intelligent enough to enjoy the higher...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are intelligent. Otherwise when the dog jumps here, and goes to one man and come here-he's enjoying. It is enjoyment. So you are doing like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But we cook very nice food to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They also eat, according to their taste. The hogs, they eat stool and they enjoy it. So, according to our calculation you are eating stool-the meat. And you are thinking you are enjoying, as the hog's thinking, that's all. It is a question of standard of enjoyment. Otherwise, enjoyment is there in every living sphere. (In car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> It sounds very nice. If we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa we can feel unlimited pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It sounds too simple to be true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But maybe we can in addition to this unlimited pleasure, just to make sure we don't lose out on anything, maybe we can also enjoy all these other pleasures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you (indistinct) motorcar and chant. You are working hard like an ass to get these motorcars. You'll get these by chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> Sometimes they say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that if everybody chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, what shape would the world be in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They would get everything, and without any labor. Just see our example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But they say that the only reason you are... Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is existing is because we are working and giving you the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must work. Because we are superior, you must work under us. (laughter) That will give you actually happiness. (indistinct) That is your duty. You are not carrying out your duty, then you will suffer. You work under our direction, you'll be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Then they say that every religion says the same thing, that if you follow them, then you will be happy. But they are all teaching differently. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Now try this. This is the latest. (laughter) You are after latest. This is the latest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadharma:</span> Sometimes people may say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that we're just trying to introduce the old caste system from India that never worked anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That caste system is already there. We are also..., we have got poor class, rich class. The Communists, they have also worker class, manager class, although the Communists against class system. But I have seen, they have made this classification: worker class, manager class. Why do you make this? That is efficiency. Leader class, follower class. Otherwise there will be chaos. This is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The divisions of work are naturally there. You can't avoid them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even in your body there is class. The head class, the arm class, the belly class, the leg class. They are working differently for benefit of the whole body. That is natural. If you avoid and if you simply keep the leg, then it will be chaotic condition. Or even if you keep the head only, that will not stand. There must be four. That is natural. That is the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span> it is said-you are reading the other day-the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they came out of the mouth. The <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they came out of the arms. The <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they came out of the belt. And the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they came out of the legs. This is <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> How you can avoid it? Kṛṣṇa says, "It is My creation. How you can avoid it?" You cannot avoid anything which is created by Kṛṣṇa. Just like sunshine. It is created by Kṛṣṇa. You cannot say, "No, no. I don't want sunshine." That is foolishness. If you want to avoid, then you'll suffer. The sunshine is there, and if you go into the dark place, and cover yourself, then the sunshine is outside, that's all. The sun may not suffer-you'll suffer. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa says that "This caste system is created by Me." If you don't accept it, then you'll suffer. Kṛṣṇa will not suffer. (leaves car) ...introducing the caste system, we are introducing a system which, you follow, you'll be happy. Not caste system. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] (in room:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadharma:</span> They say in India that the caste system apparently is not working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Shall I answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But at present the caste system in India isn't actually representative of the original <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama dharma</span> system. The original system was a cooperation, organized cooperation between four kinds of men which are naturally there in society. Just like now we can see that some people are working as laborers, some people are working as merchants, and some people politicians and lawyers, some are teachers. Originally they were organized so that the priests, or priestly order, were benefiting everyone by their teaching. And so that they could fully concentrate on that, they were not engaged in working for food and money. But what happened in this age, was that the higher caste became fallen, and they misused their high position, and instead of helping everyone by their teaching, they misused the position, or exploited the position, simply for selfish ends, so there became a conflict between the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vested interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Vested interest. Yes. So then there was conflict between the lower and the higher and it broke down. So what we're teaching is not actually the caste system as it is now or it was recently, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have also caste system in the Western countries. You are not without caste system. There is a priestly class. So there are politicians, there are industrialists, merchants, and ordinary laborer. Where is...? How you can say there is no caste system in your country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadharma:</span> But there may be the clergymen and the mercantile class and the soldiers and the laborers, in this particular society, but this society is breaking away from that because they are not recognizing the clergy class of men because nobody is going to church, nor is anybody giving any money to the church these days. This is why many churches...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all think, that you say that your charge is "They are introducing caste system." But the Hindu caste system is already there. How do you say that I am introducing? That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadharma:</span> That is my foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing lightly) You cannot say that I have introduced it. It is already there. As it is there in India, it is also everywhere. It may be under different names. The four classes are already there, everywhere. The... Even in Muslim, they have also got the (indistinct), what is called, <span class="Italic">mohallas,</span> priestly class. They have got. We are introducing the systematic caste system, but caste system is already there, everywhere. Maybe under different names. And it is necessary. The caste system is there as a matter of necessity. You cannot abolish it. But it is now existing in a deformed manner. People should be systematic and organized. That we are trying to. Not that a new thing we are trying to introduce. It is already there. Our proposition is that "You priestly class, you must act exactly as a priest-ideal priest. You are a drunkard, you are woman-hunter, you are doing everything nonsense, and at the same time you are passing on as priest-this should be stopped." This should be stopped. The priestly class, or the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they should be trained up to become truthful, how to control mind, how to control senses, and tolerant, and very learned, knowing God also-these things are required. They should be the first-class, ideal men. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they must be fearless; they must be very boldly, face fighting the enemies; they must have the capacity to govern nicely so that people will not have any complaint against the government. In this way they should be trained up. And the mercantile class of man, they should produce enough food grains, not motor tires. That is <span class="Italic">śūdra's</span> business-artisans-that is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> The <span class="Italic">vaiśyas'</span> business is first to see that in the country there is enough food for eating-both for the human being and the animals. The human being should not complain that there is no sufficient food grains, therefore they're eating flesh. No. Flesh is not for human being. They should live on food grains. Just like <span class="Italic">dahl. Dahl</span> is as good as meat. It is from food grain. And there is sufficient varieties of <span class="Italic">dahl</span> they can eat. They can make so many preparations, palatable preparations. Why are the prices of food grains increasing? Because there is shortage. If there is enough food, the price will automatically decrease, because everyone want to sell. So, the price will decrease, naturally. It will be so lavishly available that you can give food grains even to the animals, like cows and goats and other so many animals. Let them eat. That is the business of the <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> man. And <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya.</span> Another business is to protect the cows, and to give them food nicely so the cows will give enough milk. And from milk, you know, so many nice preparations, all full of vitamins. So why they should be killed? You are killing; the blood is not utilized, you are taking the flesh. But flesh is transformation of the blood. And milk is also transformation of the blood. So if you take, just like <span class="Italic">channa,</span> it is as good as flesh. By taste, by benefit-as good as. So why if you <span class="Italic">can</span> take the flesh and blood in a human way-blood is transformed into milk, and from milk there are so many good preparations-ghee, yoghurt, <span class="Italic">burfi, channa,</span> so many preparations are available. This <span class="Italic">panir, channa,</span> and let the animal live peacefully. Why are you cutting his throat? You require some benefit from the animal. Take this benefit. Why should you kill? If he can live and give better service, then why shall I try to kill? What is this human civilization? Is that human civilization, that I am taking service from you, and I am cutting your throat? Is that humanity? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadharma:</span> No, it's animal civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who takes milk... Everyone takes milk. The cow is the mother. Mother gives milk. And mother, when she cannot supply milk, mother should be cut up. Is that a very good philosophy? Is it human philosophy? What is the answer? But if you say that somebody wants to, say in your country majority they want to eat meat. So, if you put that argument, then you can eat some lower animals. You can eat the pigs. You are eating also, pigs. Not in a massive scale. Massive scale-if you are Christian you should follow your religious scripture: "Thou shall not kill!" This should be the principle. But if you are a <span class="Italic">rākṣasa,</span> if you want to eat meat, then at least don't kill the cows. You can eat other, insignificant animals. You are eating also. You are eating everything. Except the moving cars, you are eating all the moving animals. The car also moves, but you cannot eat. Otherwise you are killing everything. You have become so civilized rascal that your business is to kill other animals and eat. You are so civilized. You are still in the crude form of human being, just like in the jungles, the aborigines, the Africans, they do not know how to develop civilization-crude methods, eating the animals. That also, they are not so uncivilized that they keep slaughterhouses. You are so uncivilized that you are keeping slaughterhouses, regularly. These Africans and other jungle people they eat meat, but they directly kill. They have no such civilization as to maintain a slaughterhouse. The tigers eat meat, but they do not keep a slaughterhouse. And you are civilized. You are keeping slaughterhouse. Why should you keep? The government shouldn't allow you to keep slaughterhouses. If anyone wants to eat meat, let them eat like tigers and others. Individually, kill one animal-a lower animal, not cows. This should be the government law. You can kill one insignificant animal, like pigs or goats. It has not very much use. You kill it in your home, before your children and family, and eat. THe government may not have any objection. But why should you maintain slaughterhouses? So the agriculturist and the mercantile men, they should produce enough food, give protection to the cows, and if there is excess, sell it. Where there is not enough food grain produced you can make business. That is the instruction given in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, kṛṣi-go-rakṣya vāṇijyam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is really needed. Nobody is interested. Everyone comes to the city, the mercantile class. They are doing business, big, big skyscraper building, and they have artificial money, paper. And instead of eating food grains they are maintaining slaughterhouses. This is not good civilization. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
