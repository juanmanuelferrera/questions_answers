<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Sure to come... Reaction, reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they found one of my <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in the immigration. So immediately he called police. (laughs) Then he, he examined. He allowed, "All right, it is all right. It is such a rubbish." But they are not very happy country, as they advertise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> What is happiness? God is happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, apart from materially, they're poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> <span class="Italic">...anudarśanam.</span> So they are poor in intelligence. This is sattvic intelligence. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anudarśanam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Divide up higher kind of intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Russian professor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> And the scientific fineness that is also in the jurisdiction of matter. But a more subtle and subtler knowledge is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now we are presenting through two of my scientific students, Doctor of Chemistry, that matter is, the source of matter is spirit. This is our theory. Generally they believe the life, life comes from matter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Life comes from matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Matter. But we, we are presenting, "No, matter comes from life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Apparently. This is not appropriate. This is Vedānta. Vedānta...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Janmādyasya yataḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> I said that just examine the healthy body. This material world is an excema expect(?) in the healthy body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Material, material atmosphere means diseased condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Diseased condition, very negligent or diseased condition, very negligent part, forming very negligent part of the whole, this material world, where creation and dissolution is compulsory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Creation and the dissolution is compulsory. That is a negligent portion of the real universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">ekāṁśena.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Otherwise, if a major portion of a body is bad, then that cannot stand. So the major portion of the universe must be healthy, wholesome. And the negligent part is the diseased portion. That is the world, where the majority lives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One fourth part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> The, the possession of Satan. It is under possession of Satan. Satan means having <span class="Italic">vikṛta-jñana</span>. That is misunderstanding. Misunderstanding is perverted. Misunderstanding is set out. Understanding is there, but it is perverted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dehātma-buddhiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Dehātma...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dehātma-buddhiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Dehātma-buddhiḥ.</span> Rather, rather the enjoying principles, offensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Enjoying mood. That is the basis of this. And mood of renunciation. That is a vapor state. That is nothing only. And the real life is the life of self-dedication and service. And the service not of any part. Or service not for any part which is like me, but for the whole, for the Divinity. As Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">athavā bahunaitena<br class="calibre2"/>kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna<br class="calibre2"/>viṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam<br class="calibre2"/>ekāṁśena sthito jagat<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 10.42]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Who lies, whose bed is infinite. <span class="Italic">Śeṣāśrita, Ananta.</span> Infinite gathered together. And though He seems to, to have a figure, but figure that, that sort of figure which can contain many, many number of infinite of our conception. Kṛṣṇa is a figure talking with Arjuna, a limited figure, but Viśvarūpa emerged from Him. How? A big Viśvarūpa emerged from a limited figure? So such limited figure, that is God. Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana has been described as only sixty..., say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eighty-four miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Thirty two miles. Thirty-two miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody says eighty-four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Āṭhār-krośa</span> (?) Vṛndāvana,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">Saloka.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> ...thirty-two miles. But <span class="Italic">Paravyoma,</span> which is to be understood as Vaikuṇṭha, means infinite, many of the <span class="Italic">paravyomas</span> is accommodated there within that thirty-two miles area. Square miles area, or something like that. That, we must be conversant with that sort of understanding. Any number of length of rope coming, but only two fingers less. Only two fingers less. Another big rope added. Again that two fingers less. This is all categorical principles. We have to be acquainted with. Then we shall go to read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> or to... (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drive the flies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> How it is possible. <span class="Italic">Eka vigraha tāṅra ananta svarūpa.</span> In one figure, He accommodates numberless of figures. <span class="Italic">Eka vigraha tāṅra ananta svarūpa.</span> But all these appear to be real and it will be shown to them who has got real <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span>. <span class="Italic">Śraddhāmayo 'yaṁ lokaḥ.</span> The world of faith. And that is substantial, not imaginary. What we say to be concrete, that will be reduced to ashes and imaginary. It will evaporate, both the scientists, material scientists, as well as the <span class="Italic">ṛṣis.</span> But this will evaporate one day with sun, moon, everything. This will evaporate, but that subtle thing stands forever. <span class="Italic">Śraddhāmayo 'yaṁ lokaḥ.</span> The experience of the region of faith stands forever, undisturbed. The world of experience is evaporating every second. And for the being who is dying every moment, every second dying, the what is to be told to us to be reality, that is, means dying every second. That sort of reality is given to us by these great persons of the present universe, big scientists, and big leaders of the knowledge(?) world. In India there is a saying that once a big mountain, he he or she expressed that she will produce a child. <span class="Italic">Parvate mūṣika bhave.</span> She has got fame just before producing child. Then the people thought, "Oh, what a big child must come when the big mountain, she feels pain to produce a..." Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Labor pain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Labor... "Then a big child must come." At last it was seen that a mice, a mouse was produced. So the big, giants of the present world, so-called leaders of the scholars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> ...scholars, with world, they are producing like a mouse. That is a dying substance, in this form or that form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Ah, this is sheer deception, a deception to be a challenge to the real thinkers. We should abhorrently throw it out at once. It is within the boundary of <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9].</span> Throw it off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I, I try to impress upon them this fact, that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is a challenge for this deception. They're simply deceived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> All sorts of deception. Even Vaikuṇṭha. <span class="Italic">Paravyome</span> (Bengali) And the calculation, even they, the self is, a sort of calculation comes between the, the servitor and the object of service, then also it throws us down. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that sort of calculation is also absurd. Where there is love, there cannot be any calculation. It is autonomous. Autonomous <span class="Italic">anurāga.</span> Cultivate, do. No sort of calculation of any benefit. The calculation disturbs autonomy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya devī-maheśa-hari-dhāma... [Bs. </span>5.43]. (Bengali) About our temple contemplation, it will be almost a skyscraper building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Will be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Skyscraper building in temple shape, with four divisions. <span class="Italic">Goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya devī-maheśa... [Bs. </span>5.43]. So Maheśa-dhāma, how it will be depicted? <span class="Italic">Pārvatī-</span>wise. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> It has been already described by Sanātana Gosvāmī in <span class="Italic">Bṛhad-Bhāgavatāmṛtam.</span> After crossing Brahmaloka,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is <span class="Italic">Maheśa-dhāma</span>, in between.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Maheśa-dhāma.</span> And the devotee, Śiva is devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone is... Śiva's devotional prayer is there in Fourth Canto, about the four sons. What are those?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Devī-dhāma. Virajā </span>to<span class="Italic"> virajā, nirviśeṣa.</span> The last conception or the highest conception of <span class="Italic">Devī-dhāma</span> is what are the conception of <span class="Italic">virajā; prakṛti</span> ends there... Then begins...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kāraṇa, kāraṇārṇava.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Kāraṇa, kāraṇārṇava</span>. Then it begins <span class="Italic">Brahmaloka,</span> the halo of the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Effulgence. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Spiritual world. And that is also some, some, somewhat <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣa.</span> And then, after crossing that, the Śiva is on the other, higher side or he is in lower side. That is differentiation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śiva is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Differentiation on two sides is Śiva. This side also, Master of Devī, and this side also. He is searching after something and when the differentiated world ends in Brahmaloka, there also Śiva is devotee. This side, Śiva is a yogī. He's searching after. And then, there, he's going to meet Nārāyaṇa, to face (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both sides, he's a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> This side, he's not such a devotee. But that is pure devotee on the other side, <span class="Italic">Vaikuṇṭha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Sadāśiva.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">paṭal</span> is there? Oh. (Bengali conversation with a little English, talking about success of the movement around the world, which vegetables to eat during Cāturmāsya and other topics for some minutes)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How within five or six years...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> (Bengali) The intellectual barrier has been crossed and from there, it is being extended to this mundane world of ours. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One intelligent boy, you have heard his name, George Harrison, he's one of the greatest musicians at the present moment, of the world. I think so, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> George Harrison. So he's becoming, he's very intelligent, so he's becoming interested. Now recently he has given us a house in London which is fifty-five lakhs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which is worth two hundred thousand pounds. Two hundred thousand pounds ordinarily, it is forty lakhs. And in the market value, because pound is selling in India thirty, twenty-eight, at least twenty-five, in that way...[break]</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(Bengali conversation for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Bhaktivedanta Book Fund account (Bengali). "Five thousand dollars. You take advance. Deposit. And take my orders." So I gave him order, "Books worth fifty-two thousands of dollars, advancing five thousand dollars." And they gradually supplied to India. And from U.S.A. we gradually, little by little, we paid. So that became the asset, of books. And I advised them that "You go and present these books to respectable gentlemen to become a member, and they'll become." And actually that plan became successful. Now the same members, they have not only paid eleven hundred. Now some of them, they're paying eleven thousand. Recently one gentleman belonging to the Birla family... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> L. M. Birla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> The other day, the family came there and Jagan(?) went there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Another family. They came to our Calcutta center. In how many motors they came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Seventeen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seventeen motor cars, whole family. And after seeing the Deity they presented a check for eleven thousand rupees. So by Kṛṣṇa's grace, money is coming. There is no scarcity. And they are spending here in Māyāpura. So with that five hundred, five thousand dollars, whatever asset is Indian now, that is from five thousand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Also you have proved also that capital is on the other world. Capital is also... So it is being supplied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, these books suppliers, Dai Nippon, they give us credit up to $200,000. $200,000, in our Indian exchange, it is twenty lakhs of rupees. So they give us credit. We take books from them and distribute and then pay. In this way, it is going on. In Los Angeles alone we are selling... How many books daily?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Two thousand, maybe. Fifteen hundred a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two thousand pieces, and the collection is about eight thousand dollars, no, eight hundred dollars. Eight hundred dollars. So they're very anxiously taking our books. A new literature. They have no such idea, what is God, what is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> How they can be explained. Our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> publisher MacMillan, within one year... Last August they, the first edition. And... Not yet August. By this time, they have finished two editions and the third edition is in the press. That will be available in July.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Fifteen thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty. Five, zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Marvelous success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> also, we have got six volumes. So people purchase the whole set, sixty dollars. Sixty dollars for the whole set? No? How much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They sell it for thirty dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thirty dollars, yes. So this is very encouraging that our books are... (Bengali) The books are selling like anything, these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Hotcakes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hotcakes, yes. We are ordering to Dai Nippon, because they are giving us facilities, 100,000 copies each. And distributed all over the world. The whole world, Australia... The whole... Australia is English-speaking. Whole America is English-speaking. England, English-speaking. And Europe also, half, English-speaking. India, more than half, English-speaking. So in this way, English literatures, worldwide circulation we are getting. And besides that, we have published in German language, in Spanish language. Just yesterday I received Spanish <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> People are liking it very much. So here is something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Who is in charge of this publication?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Publication... I have made one Trust, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Where is that Bali-mardana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bali-mardana. Bali-mardana and another, Karandhara dāsa Adhikārī. So actually he's the manager, Karandhara dāsa Adhikārī. He is looking after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> At America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Los Angeles. He's very intelligent boy. He knows everything. He knows accounts, He knows how to construct building. He knows how to manage. He knows how to publish. Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Versatile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Versatile, yes. And he's not very old. And he wants to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> also. He's a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> he has got a child. And: "Just wait. We shall arrange for your... You are already <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span>" He lives apart from his wife. So he's very nice boy.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> So much clear conception in such a small period of time, that they have acquired. This is a marvelous thing. The Dāmodara also, ISKCON has said in such a way, this Dāmodara Svarūpa and the Paṇḍita Dāmodara. Generally, these are for public, but minute reader only can differentiate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dāmodara. Svarūpa Dāmodara and Dāmodara Paṇḍita.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Dāmodara Paṇḍita. Two different, but one is Lalitā. Another is a <span class="Italic">mañjarī</span> of Candrāvalī, Paṇḍita Dāmodara.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our present Tīrtha Mahārāja, Bhakti-Vilāsa-Tīrtha Mahārāja, he's representing Prabhupāda. At least, he tries to pose himself. So Bon Mahārāja's activities, in comparison to that, my activities certainly better. And Bon Mahārāja was given so much reception. But he did not give me any reception. How he can claim to be Prabhupāda's representative?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Bon Mahārāja was given reception because Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Prabhupāda appreciated anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But here there is no appreciation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> He's representing, he's representing the mission, he thinks. He thinks so, but he's so poor in his preaching capacity that he cannot accommodate any other in his camp than him and Vinohe(?). I heard a story of Maharashtra. In old days, there was a good king who encouraged the <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> very much. And he had got in his assembly a scholar, one Balarāma. He always looked after this, that. No <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> can have any entrance to that Mahārāja. And he professed himself to be, he is the biggest <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> in the land. So once Kālidāsa... At the time of Kālidāsa. Kālidāsa, when he heard, then he found a plan. And went to that <span class="Italic">paṇḍita,</span> that "I a poor <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> I want some, some sort of money from the king. You are all in..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Recommend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> "Please recommend me." "Oh, yes. And then what sort of scholarship you have got? Do you..., can you compose any poem?" "Yes. I can." "Then do it." Then: <span class="Italic">uttiṣṭhottiṣṭha bhū-rājan mukhaṁ prakṣālaya atha, roditi na ghare kukurana vaidyuhi na vaidyo hi.</span>(?) This stanza. What is the meaning? (laughs) The <span class="Italic">uttiṣṭhottiṣṭha rājan.</span> "Oh King,..."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wash up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> "...cleanse your mouth. Wash your mouth." And <span class="Italic">ta</span> what is this <span class="Italic">ta?</span> "Well, keep it in your hand." <span class="Italic">Roditi na ghare kukura</span>... "The <span class="Italic">ta</span> must come here." <span class="Italic">Roditi na ghare kukura ta mughi.</span> "That <span class="Italic">ta</span> is placed there in advance, that <span class="Italic">ta</span> must come here." <span class="Italic">Roditi na ghare kukura ta.</span> "But for the <span class="Italic">caṇḍa,</span> and it has been removed there. And that one word, the place was empty. So this <span class="Italic">ta</span> has been positioned, has been placed there." <span class="Italic">Roditi na ghare kukura.</span> "And what is this <span class="Italic">Ca vai tu ki, ca vai tu ki?</span> No." "This is <span class="Italic">ca-vai-tu-ki,</span> all these letters only to <span class="Italic">pada,</span> for <span class="Italic">pada pūraṇa.</span> So this fourth <span class="Italic">pada,</span> I could not fill up. So these four things have been placed here." <span class="Italic">ca vai tu ki,</span> "Oh, that's very good I'll put it to the king."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He saw it is very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> "How, how a scholar I am I! I wrote this is the specimen of other scholars." (Bengali-recites some verses) And this sort of poems was produced by him in the court. The king was charmed. This man was perplexed. So Tīrtha Mahārāja (?) is like Balarāma. And he, and he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody should be allowed. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> And when he find man comes around him, then he will be nowhere to the... He's, he's, he's knows one thing, that <span class="Italic">Haritaki.</span> You know that story of <span class="Italic">Haritaki.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (Laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> He knows this <span class="Italic">canar-dharma.</span> (?)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Tusarkanti (?) very much appreciates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this <span class="Italic">canar-dharma.</span> Because that Gaura Mahārāja, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He told me that he was given...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> He wanted election of Vāsudeva Prabhu, Gaura Mahārāja and that <span class="Italic">Bhagavānānanda,</span> but Paraśurāma. But anyhow, he escaped and he came to Tīrtha Mahārāja, his former relative, old Tīrtha Mahārāja, former relative. Then Tīrtha Mahārāja told him that "What about <span class="Italic">my</span> guru?" "Well, if your guru on one side, another bullock in another side. And if you can plow and produce some crops, and that can be offered to Mahāprabhu, then your guru may have a path of relish." (laughs) See what Tīrtha Mahārāja says, "This is blasphemy." "No, it is true, but this is very cruel. But this is truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara Mahārāja:</span> If he's presently the <span class="Italic">pakka</span> Māyāvādī, if he's used passively by a great man then only in that way he can come this side. Not in front walking. Not by front walking. Only by back drawing, he can be taken to this side only. It is quite true. That... So Cinmayānanda. Now Gaura Mahārāja, he knows me better, and he, he's a paid Goswami of those <span class="Italic">Patrikā</span> persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
