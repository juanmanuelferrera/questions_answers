<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he hopes we excuse if he has some basic questions that he wanted to ask. And his first question was regarding <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span> What is the symbolism, significance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is just like your cross, amongst Christian. It is temple of Viṣṇu. Not only here, we have got twelve place: here, here, here, here, here. Twelve place. The idea is being protected by Viṣṇu from all sides.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The shaved head, he's asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is cleanliness. Instead of keeping unnecessary hair, we keep very clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> These traditions have existed for a long time, he's asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Especially the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they keep the shaven head. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇas</span> are the topmost class. What is the symptoms of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca<br class="calibre2"/>jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-karma svabhāva-jam<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.42]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness, these are the qualities by which the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> work."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the Vedic conception is that the human society should be divided into four divisions, namely the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> natural division. One section of the human society should work as the brain. Another section should work just like the arms, another section, like the belly, another section, like the leg. These four divisions are essential. That is also mentioned, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> You want to read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">"According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me." (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like by nature there are four division in the body-the brain, the arm, the belly, and..., all of them required... You cannot reject any one of them. Then it is not fullness. But the brain should be the, I mean to say, prime director, managing director. So the qualification of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> are stated. <span class="Italic">Śamo damas titikṣā?</span> Eh? So at the present moment the society has no brain because there is no person, no person who is qualified like that, <span class="Italic">samo damas titikṣā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So their qualification, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> qualification, find out. Page?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> It's eight twelve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Eight twelve?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 812.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (reads verse 18.42 in French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, "Does this Kṛṣṇa consciousness message apply as well to the outcastes?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Outcaste? There are four castes only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (1):</span> But there are the outcastes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Do you mean the untouchables?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Outcaste means those who are less than the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> They are called <span class="Italic">pañcamas.</span> These are four divisions: <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra. Śūdra</span> means laborer class but they are also obedient to the other three classes. And less than that, they have been described as <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas, pañcamas,</span> or untouchable as you say. But for us, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, there is no such distinction. Anyone can become Kṛṣṇa conscious. The <span class="Italic">pañcamas,</span> the fifth class men are called <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas. Caṇḍāla</span> means untouchable. So they are also many: <span class="Italic">kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> So Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is... <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya<br class="calibre2"/>ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās<br class="calibre2"/>te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 9.32]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth-women, <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> [merchants], as well as <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> [workers]-can approach the supreme destination."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there is no such distinction because we are interested with the soul. The soul is the same everywhere and these designations are different. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is above designation. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> One is freed from all designation. Actually, on the spiritual level, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, anyone who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is above all these divisions. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītya.</span> Find out. <span class="Italic">Māṁ ca avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate, sa guṇān...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Nitāi:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The designations are on the material platform according to the quality. But in the spiritual platform it is transcendental to material qualities. So when one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious there is no more distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says this seems to be somewhat different from the traditional Hindu practice, since in the <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā,</span> for example, <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are not to be instructed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but we do not keep him <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> A devotee is no longer <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> We are creating <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Just like these Europeans and Americans. They, according to <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā,</span> they are <span class="Italic">mlecchas, yavanas.</span> But we are not keeping them <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas.</span> Just like these European and American boys. They are accepting the Vedic regulatives principles: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling. So they are no more <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> or <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span> They are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is said, <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> according to quality and work. When one is educated in the quality of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> Vaiṣṇava, and he works like a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he is no longer <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> or <span class="Italic">yavana.</span> He is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, in a sense we're something like the Buddhists because the Buddhists also don't take account of this, of the caste system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Buddhist or anyone. Just like a person, when he is not educated in medical science he is not a medical man, but when he is properly educated in the medical science and he practices as a medical man, then he is a medical man. So you take it from Buddhism, or Hinduism; it doesn't matter. The thing is, consideration is, <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma.</span> One must be qualified and he must work. Then he is elevated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In other words, he's saying, what we're saying is that spiritually, everyone is equal, which is actually the same as the Christian idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Spiritually, not materially. Materially there must be distinction. Materially there must be distinction. But spiritually there is no distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> What was his first point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> The point was that in Christianity everyone can become Christian whereas it seems in this only some can become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So he is interested what is the path to becoming <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> How does one become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> means purified. Just like in Christianity also there are ten commandments. If you do not obey the ten commandments, how you can become Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, the quality. The quality of Christian is that he must obey the ten commandments. If he does not obey, then where is his Christianity? That is stated, <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma:</span> by quality and work one becomes Christian or Hindu or Muslim. There must be the quality. But when the spirituality develops either from Christianity or Hindu or Muslim-it doesn't matter-then there is. Find out that verse, <span class="Italic">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> Read it. This is the ideal of equality. Find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo<br class="calibre2"/>yato bhaktir adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>ahaituky apratihatā<br class="calibre2"/>yayātmā suprasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.6]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"The supreme occupation, <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our, this movement is to create lover of God. It does not matter whether he follows Christianity or Hinduism or Buddhism or this ism or that ism. One must be lover of God, and that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> That is first-class religion which turns the followers to become lover of God, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roche-dieu:</span> In Christianity, mystics would emphasize the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the essence of religion, to know God and to love Him. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roche-dieu:</span> Yes. Love God and love the man too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why man? Simply love God; then you will love everyone. Because God is the center, God is the father of everyone, so if you love the father, automatically you love the sons. It is not required that you simply love this son and not that son. That is not love of Godhead. "I love human being but I do not love the poor animals. Send them to the slaughterhouse." This is not love of God. So in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you will find, God says,</div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So God is the Supreme Father. It is not that He is father of the human being. He is father of the animals, He is father of the trees, He is father of the animals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roche-dieu:</span> Living being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Living, any living. We are all living beings. We are in different dresses. Just like you are European; you have got a different dress. I am an Indian; I have got a different dress. But dress is not consideration. You are a human being; I am a human being. Similarly, all the living entities, they are dressed in 8,400,000's of dresses. But they are living being. And all the living beings are part and parcel of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roche-dieu:</span> (French) Life is a whole view, and there is no division between animals and man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritually advanced man, God conscious, there is no such distinction that "Here is an animal; here is a man." He sees that spirit soul is there in the animal and in the man, in the tree, in the plant, in the aquatics, the same spirit soul. Read that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The father is God, and they are all sons. But they have, they have been given different types of dress according to <span class="Italic">karma.</span> So when actually one loves God, he loves all of them as brothers, not that only human being. That is not love of God. Then he does not know what is God. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you'll not find a single sentence where it is recommended that "Only love the human being." There is no such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He's asking, "Well, that's all right. But this love that we have for God, only man can give it. An animal can't love God. A tree can't love God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you can love animal. You are not animal. Animal... Just like we are discussing about theosophy because we are grown up, and the child, he cannot understand. That does not mean we shall be unkind to the children. He may be ignorant, the animal may be ignorant, but I am not ignorant. How can I kill the animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He's asking, "How do we see ourselves and how is it that we intentionally distinguish ourselves by dressing differently, by having a different presentation than the rest of society."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Given the fact that all others, they are loving God too, the same principle, Christianity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, symptoms must be there. If you love God, then you should love everything of God. You cannot distinguish that "These are human beings. They should be given service, and the animals should be sent to the slaughterhouse." That is not love of God. That means he does not know what is God. He is still unaware of God. Just like father. Father has got ten sons. Out of them, one is very intelligent or two are very intelligent; others are fools. And if the intelligent sons propose to the father, "Father, these are useless sons. Let me kill," will the father agree? So God is father of all living entities. He is providing food for the animal, for the man, because He is father. There is, in the jungle of Africa elephants. They are eating at a time hundred kilos. The father is providing. And the ant, a small ant, is eating one grain of sugar. He is providing. Within the hole of your room there are millions of ants. The father is providing food for them. That is God. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> That one is providing all necessities of life to everyone, all living entities. That is God. So if I know God, then I can know also that all of them are sons of God and God is providing all their necessities of life. What right I have got to kill them?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because our proposal is that unless you become... Find out that verse, <span class="Italic">yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām, te dvandva-moha-nirmuktāḥ.</span> This is the beginning of theism.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Doesn't that make us rather exclusive, that we have some facility for spending all of our time meditating and purifying our lives?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What meditation? The thing is that here it is stated, "Unless one is free from all sinful activities, he cannot be engaged in My service." And the pillars, according to Vedic, pillars of sinful activities... Just like four pillars. One is this meat-eating, the other is illicit sex, the other is gambling, and the other is intoxication. So unless we break these four pillars of sinful life there is no meaning of meditation or worshiping God. You cannot ignite fire, at the same time pour water on it. So sinful life means destruction of spiritual life. So once you begin spiritual life, and other way you begin sinful life, then how it will be? It is counteracted. There is no progress.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I say that you help your fellow man. So do you know how to help him?</div>

The doctor says that he should not eat anything. But if you think that "Let me give  some food. The doctor is very cruel. He is not giving food," is it, that, helping or fully pushing him towards death? First of all you must know how to help. If I do not know-I help in the opposite way-that is not helping. That is degrading. These are all manufactured things. They are not... Helping means, real helping is, that a man or anyone... Everyone is suffering for want of knowledge.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The first thing is that this gentleman doesn't agree. He doesn't think that the major problem is ignorance.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that pride is there. That gentleman is proud that he's helping someone. That prideness is there. But out of these two kinds of prideness, one prideness which is real, that is welcome. If one is falsely proud, that is useless. But if one is actually proud of doing something, then he... That is good. Just like in the Vedic literature it is recommended that you should feel <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi:</span> "I am Brahman." This is also ego. This is real ego, that "I am spirit soul." This is not bad. But when one thinks, "I am this body," he's a rascal. If one thinks that "I am servant of God," that is real ego. And if one thinks, "I am servant of Satan," that is not very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I think this gentleman still isn't feeling satisfied about his question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That how can we say that to give people..., that the only real problem is to give knowledge. There are people who are starving; there are people who are sick; there are people who are in so much distress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot do. You cannot do. There are so many people starving in the hospital. What can you do?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then this is simply a false pride, that "I can do something." You cannot do anything. Rather, you can do this service, that "There is God. You are servant of God. Please become servant of God." And if you make this program, "I can give food to so many," what you can do? There are millions and millions. People are starving all over the world. What can you do? It is simply false pride. You cannot do anything. Now, just like I have heard that in your country, because they have got excess milk supply there was recommendation to kill twenty thousand cows. Is it a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is it very good intelligence? Because there is excess of milk supply, why not supply it to others who are starving for milk?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there are so many human beings also dying out of hunger. Is it to be recommended that they should be killed? There are many human being also; they are also skeletons. They have no sufficient food. So if you think that the cows are skeletons for want of food, you supply them food. Why you are restricting? If... The Americans, they are throwing tons of food in the water. Why they do not send to India for feeding the skeleton cows? What the cows have done? They are also living entity. Why you are thinking of human beings, not of the cows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says for Protestants especially, there is a feeling that to think that we can become purified of our sins by following some formulary, that is a kind of false pride, that actually to become free...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why Christ recommend, "Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not covet. Thou shall not do this. Thou shall not..."? They are all false thing? Now let us talk of knowledge. We have talked so many outside knowledge. What is the real knowledge? The real knowledge is that everything is the property of God. <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> No land belongs either to the Americans or to the Swiss people or to the Indian people or to German people. No. Everything belongs to God. And all living entities are the sons of God. So everything produced out of God's land, either on the land or in the sky or anywhere, it is God's property, and all the sons, they have the right to share. So there is no scarcity in the God's kingdom. Simply due to our mismanagement we have created so much trouble. If we accept God as the center and all living entities sons of God, then we can actually live very peacefully in God consciousness. Therefore this is the recommendation, how we can live very peacefully, all of us, both men and animal and everyone.

So God is controlling everything. There are two things-material and spiritual. We have got experience. Suppose in this city of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (4):</span> Geneva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Geneva, there are varieties of living entities and also houses and mountains. So two things, animate and inanimate. One section, animate; another section, inanimate. So we are small gods, or <span class="Italic">īśvaras.</span> We may control the government and the management of the street and parks and everything, but we are controlled by the supreme. As supreme God, the supreme controller is not controlled by anyone. I am controlling, but I am being controlled by somebody else. That is God. So therefore we have to admit, we must admit that we are not free. We are controlled. Eh? By superior power or superior controller we are controlled. Therefore our duty is to be controlled according to His desire. So if we agree to be controlled by the Supreme, that is perfect life. And if we do not like to come to be controlled by the supreme, that is sinful life. And this is the perfect knowledge.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that for Christians, this feeling of being with God comes from praying to Lord Jesus Christ. He's asking if Kṛṣṇa has that same position for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Kṛṣṇa is God, and Christ is son of God. We don't find any difference between the son and the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Kṛṣṇa, he thinks, is an <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> of Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Kṛṣṇa, he says, is an <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> of Viṣṇu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa is the same thing. It is external. Kṛṣṇa... Somebody says Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> of Viṣṇu, and we say that Viṣṇu is expansion of Kṛṣṇa. Now, this example I have already given. Just like one candle. The another, ignite another candle, ignite another candle... Now, all these candles, so far light-giving power the same. But you can call, "This is first candle. This is second candle." And if you say the second candle is first candle, so there is no trouble because the candle power is the same.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, do we see Kṛṣṇa as being a savior in the way that Christians see Christ as being the savior?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean by "savior"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He say the savior is one who rekindles the spiritual spark that reunites the living being with God. So the savior is in between God and the living being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Savior means who saves you from this material existence. He is called savior. Because the living entity, being entangled in this material existence, he is suffering, so savior means one who saves from this material entanglement and gets him back to God, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> When they think of the savior, they're talking about the guru, the spiritual master. He's asking, is Kṛṣṇa our guru? Kṛṣṇa, we consider Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru means the representative of God. Just like Christ is son of God, guru is also son of God. So there is no much difference because they will say the same thing, that "You are suffering in this material world on account of material entanglement. So you give up this business. Come back to home, back to Godhead." So this is the real message. This message is given by God, by His son, by His servant. The message is the same. If one does not give this message he is neither guru, nor son, nothing of the sort.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> What interests them is the underlying nature of our spiritual practice as opposed to theirs.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are also thinking of Kṛṣṇa always.

We are always remembering Kṛṣṇa. So the real process is... Either you think of Kṛṣṇa or son of Kṛṣṇa, it doesn't matter, but you should always think of Him. That is the requisition. That is recommended. That is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru,</span> Ninth Chapter.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Now either you engage your mind in Kṛṣṇa or Jesus does not matter. It is same thing. But this is the process. "Engage your mind in Me." Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are teaching this, that engage your mind to God or the son of god; it doesn't matter. But your mind should be godly engaged. That's all. That is meditation. That is real meditation: "Always think of Me." And in another place, in Sixth Chapter, you see,</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"The first-class yogi is he who is always thinking of Me." So it doesn't matter you are Christian, I am Hindu. The real point is that think of God or God's representative always. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Swiss Man (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates) And in that situation, always thinking of God like that, our philosophy is that naturally these others things, charity, humanitarian works, they will all come naturally?</div>

If the good qualities does not manifest in you, that means you are not yet perfect in God consciousness. Just like you European boys, American boys, why you have given... [break] ...one of the item is that good quality that "Why shall I give trouble, pain, to other animals?" This is within the God consciousness. Just like poor-feeding. This program we also follow. In our temple, especially in India, any man can come and take his food. Yes. We have got arrangement. In the U.S.A also, Los Angeles, New York, we invite anyone, "Come and take food." We don't want to see that anyone is hungry. We don't want to see. So God consciousness means all the good ideas we are manufacturing, they will be manifested in God consciousness automatically. Therefore our duty should be, if we want to make all human being well-behaved, then we must try to make every one of them God conscious.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not know better than Kṛṣṇa. So one association is sufficient. There is no need of going this Aurobindo, Saurobindo. We never... Why should we waste our time? We have got sufficient education in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. First of all let us finish these hundred books of four hundred pages. Then we shall see what Aurobindo writes. We don't think anyone can speak better than Kṛṣṇa. That is admitted.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aurobindo was... Aurobindo, Vivekananda, they started talking something in the Western world hundred years ago. But not a single man became Kṛṣṇa devotee.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (guests leave) These Aurobindos or Vivekanandas and Gandhis, they have spoiled Hindu culture. Vedic culture they have spoiled. Hodgepodge writing, hodgepodge speaking, dry speaking, speculation-choked up the progress of Vedic civilization. Now here is some hope. People are now taking it. Now, did I say wrong, that "Why shall I go to Aurobindo?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> You never say wrong. (laughs) All of your answers were right, great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got better instruction than Aurobindo. Why shall I go to Aurobindo, waste my time? People don't know anything. Nobody has become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa in reading Aurobindo's literature. And here, as soon as they saw our literature, immediately police officer said, "Oh, you are so high." Immediately. Where is the record, the professors and universities eager to purchase Aurobindo's book and Vivekananda's books? There is no record. But here they are eager "All sixty books, please, sir." "All twelve books, please, sir."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Why are they so attracted to humanitarianism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is false pride. This has been taught. In the Christianity they have taught like that, giving medicine, open hospital. That is Christianity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He admitted it himself. He said himself, "It's a false pride to think..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "...think we can do something."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot do anything. But they show. They make a collection, that "We are doing such nice work." The Vivekananda also imitated like that and could not do anything. It is not possible. Swami Nikhilananda said... He belongs to the Vivekananda group. Because they raise funds from America, huge funds, that "We shall feeding the poor in India." And they eat meat and big, big become fat, these rascals. So the Americans asked them that "You are taking away our money somewhere to feed the poor. But when we go to India, two sides we see all poor men are lying on the street. What you have done?" So this is a slogan. They cannot do anything. Thinking of poor... Now, those who have accepted voluntarily povertyism, the hippies, what you are doing for them? Why don't you make arrangement for their gentlemanly living? They are not poverty-stricken. Why they are living like wretches, lying on the street, no program for eating, no for sleeping, no for bodily comfort, just like animals? What you have done for them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Because the real problem is not poverty. That they haven't understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> If you have bad <span class="Italic">karma,</span> then you must suffer by the laws of nature. You may be a rich man's son or king's son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Christ, he actually also said that. There's one verse in the Bible. Christ said, "The poor you will always have with you, but I will not be with you always." He said that also. They misunderstand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good idea. Therefore I said Jesus Christ is son of God, so what he says and what Kṛṣṇa says, there is no difference. This has become a hackneyed slogan, "poor feeding." To do to the humanity-and cut the throat of the animal. What is this philosophy, nonsense philosophy? They have no conception of God. If he has got conception of God, then everyone<span class="Italic">-paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Oh, why for the benefit of the human being, other animals' throat should be cut? Even they have no common sense. National. National means one who is born in that land. That is national. So why the animals born in that land, they are not national?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> You used a very nice example, that the children, they are ignorant but that does not mean you kill them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Is there any meaning, "Oh, these are foolish children creating trouble, so I will kill them"? What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There was a story in Time magazine last week. Everyone was in a big flurry about it. An airplane crashed in the Andes mountains, and they were stranded way up in the mountains for eighteen days without any food. So there were maybe fifty people on the plane and only eighteen survivors. So because there was no food they ate the bodies. They ate the dead bodies to survive. Then, eighteen days later they were saved. A plane came and picked them up and brought them back. So people are very, very much excited, "Oh, what is this amazing occurrence, that they ate human flesh?" But every day they are eating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cow's flesh. When it was?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I think so. I'm not sure. I don't know for sure. But in the mountains a plane crashed and there were eighteen survivors. And to stay alive they ate the dead bodies of the passengers who died. So there were many articles. "What was it like?" Everyone wants to know, "What was it like to eat human flesh? Do you feel bad now that you have eaten human flesh?" "No."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Icy, cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It was very cold. There was no plants, no nothing. They had to stay inside the plane just to stay alive, to stay warm. So they could not go and get food anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> And the bodies were already dead. And there were certain people that they knew their bodies, his fiance or his sister. They agreed that if they were going to eat the bodies they would eat them last. It's true. It was in the story. One man, he had his prospective wife. One man had his sister or sister-in-law, cousin. They said, "If we're going to eat the bodies, then we'll eat them the last." So they had a sense that this body is more important than that body, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in last war they ate stool also.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There's a story about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Viśvāmitra. How they exist in that open, and there was snow. For eating they... Eighteen days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The plane crashed. Half the people were killed. So the other people, two of them left to go find help. They went to find out some people they could telephone or something. It took them eighteen days to find a house. So the other people, they all stayed close together inside the airplanes. They put on blankets and their coats. But there was no... They could not go outside. There was no food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They had... At first they had little chocolate and they rationed it out that "You get a little bit of chocolate," and little bit of liquid they had. And so they rationed it out until that was finished. Then they took a vote amongst themselves. "Well, what shall we do? Shall we eat human flesh or shall we simply starve to death?" So they voted amongst themselves that "Yes, we should do this." There were some men, one or two, that would not do it and they died. They refused to do it, and they died. Others, they did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They made some... Afterwards they had to... There was some discussion, some philosophy. They were actually discussing. And there was one person there who was explaining to the others that "We must eat this flesh to stay alive but it's not so wrong since the soul has left the body." He said, "The spirit has left these bodies, so you shouldn't consider it to be quite so bad. We're obliged to do this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is not unreasonable. It was a question of selection. Otherwise, to subsist, to eat the dead bodies, flesh, that is not very abominable. That can be accepted. But it is the selection whether one will eat. That is another thing. Otherwise dead body's flesh is as good as anything else because it is matter.</div>
