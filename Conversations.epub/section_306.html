<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this gentleman is Dr. Christian...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hauser?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, I see. And he's a very good friend of Gauracandra. He's a devotee from Amsterdam. And he's a professional psychiatrist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Prabhupāda's just saying his <span class="Italic">mantra, Gāyatrī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So very glad to see you. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> You see, when I met George, he was a very, what do you call it, person that hadn't found anything very specific in life. He floated about very much and he... Now when I met him yesterday he was very, he seemed very happy and very sure of himself and what he was doing, and that made me very happy. I thought that was something very nice. I liked him very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the original status of the living entity. Just like a son is conscious always that "I am the son of such and such person." This consciousness is natural. So living entities, when they come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness... Because we are all parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa. It cannot be broken. A person may go mad. But when he's cured, he immediately understands that "I belong to such and such family, such and such gentleman's son." That is natural. Similarly in the contact of this material nature, the spiritual spark, living entity, he's in madness. You are a psychiatrist. You know very well. Every man is more or less a madman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Or he has the germ within himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We say in a Bengali poetry:</div>
<div class="Verse">piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya<br class="calibre2"/>māyā-grasta jīvera haya se bhāva udaya</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Anyone who is infected with this material energy, he is just like a man, ghostly haunted. You have any experience of ghostly haunted men? A ghost captures him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Ghostly haunted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Possessed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Oh yes. But that's very often a symptom of a, of a psychosis that they feel that they are persecuted by, by foreign powers or by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Foreign powers, yes. So this is called ghostly haunted. So our material conception of life, this is also ghostly haunted, madness. "I am Christian. I am Hindu. I am Muslim. I am Englishman. I am German." These are all conception of ghostly haunted. Because spirit soul is pure. In the Vedic language it is said: <span class="Italic">asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ.</span> The spirit soul has no connection with such designations. Just like in dream we see so many things. But it has nothing to do with me. So this is night dream. At night, we forget all these things about the day dream. "I am this, I am that. I am this family-member. I am his father. I am his husband." And so on, so on. At night, when dream, are in a different situation. And we forget everything. And again, in daytime, we forget everything of the night dream. We come another dream. So this is also dream. That is also dream. I am simply observing. In daytime I am seeing some dream, gross dream, and at nighttime I'm seeing some subtle dream. But seer, I am. Under different condition, I am seeing different things. I think you treats this madness. He's sees things in different way, in different positions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Hmm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everyone is mad. Anyone who is in material contact, he is mad. So we are trying to take him out of this dreaming condition. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But does he stop dreaming? I mean, substantially, does he stop, stop, does one stop dreaming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Stop means... Because dreaming means that is not my actual occupation. Dreaming means that. I am separate from the dreaming condition. So if one stops this dreaming condition, then he's cured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But the dreaming of the night also has another function, according to my...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Dreaming at night, dreaming at day. The same thing. The pattern is different. Pattern is different. If you think that you are Englishman, you are Swedish, or if you are Hindu, you are Muslim, that is also dream. You are none of this. As much as you are none of those dreaming things at night. But due to our madness, sometimes we take: "This is fact," sometimes we take: "That is fact." But none of them are facts. Under different condition, we accept them as facts. But none of them are facts. Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness means: <span class="Italic">sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one becomes freed from all designations. <span class="Italic">Upādhi. Upādhi</span> means designation. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam.</span> Completely free from all designation. Just like in dream I think I have become now king. I am the proprietor of a factory. But none of them. It is only dream. Similarly, in day dream I am thinking I am the father of this family, I am the mother of this family, I am this, I am that. That is all dreaming. So one has to become free from this dreaming condition. That is called <span class="Italic">sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">,</span> liberated from all kinds of false designation. Designation... Designation means false...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But some of these false, false designations also are the machinery of a society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is also false.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Although they're false, but they, they sort of drive the society on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Although, although these designations are false, they are driving on a whole society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The whole society's driving on so many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we call it is illusion, <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like I showed you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, the reflection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reflection. I, in morning walk, the sun was reflected in a glass exactly it is brilliant as sun. So I showed him: "This is called <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> illusion. There is no sun, but it appears like sun. Exactly. And it is illuminating also." Reflection of the moon. So one who is less intelligent, he'll see: "Oh, here is a sun, another sun." So he's a madman. One who sees the sun reflection in the glass as sun, he's illusioned. He's mad. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is also psychiatrist movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Is that a...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Psychiatric.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Psychiatric movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Oh, yes, yes. In a way... I... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. We are taking away a person from the illusionary stage to the real stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But it also seems to me that you have, by gaining this consciousness, you can skip a lot of hard work that it takes in ordinary analysis or in a group therapy, for example...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No hard work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> You have to work a lot with yourself to gain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> ...insight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very easy, very easy. Just like we, we recommend this chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Anyone can chant. Even child can chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> His point is that we, our processes skips all this work that they do in an ordinary psychiatric ward or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> No. Yes. Or in specific processes which are directed towards insight, the same kind of insight that I imagine you are striving for.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We ask them to refrain from four prohibitive principles. No illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating, no intoxication. And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Refrain from these prohibitions. And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And he becomes sane, Kṛṣṇa conscious. Very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yeah, it sounds easy. I hope it works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see all the examples. Well, the same... I have not given them any bribe or anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> No, no, no. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they'll talk in my favor. But talk with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, I've talked to them, and they... That's why I'm here because I'm not, I'm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the process is very simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we don't charge anything. You charge, of course, some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Oh yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we don't charge anything. Free. I began this treatment in New York, and it is coming effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> All over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think you should adopt this means. A simple method. Don't charge anything. Simply ask him to do this. He'll be cured. (pause) <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">. Nirmalam</span> means completely cured. <span class="Italic">Mala</span> means dirty things. And <span class="Italic">nirmala</span> means just opposite, no dirty things. <span class="Italic">Nirmalam. Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.</span> When the senses are freed from all dirty things, then it can be engaged in the service of the Lord. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> One, one very normal problem that I meet very often in patients is the security to feel that one can believe in something, a security of... Always there is... Very often there is an ambivalence. "Should I believe? Should I not believe? I have a, a..." Swaying to and fro.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Believe... There is no question of believe. Suppose you are hungry. I give you some food. I say: "You are hungry. Take this food." So when you take this food, you'll believe that: "Yes, my hunger is now satisfied. I'm getting strength." That is belief. So you are hungry, and if I give you some food, if you don't eat, then how you can believe that your hunger is now satisfied? You must eat. So we say: "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." So why not chant? Where is the loss? If there is any gain, let me take it. That is belief. If I say: "You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." so you have got tongue, you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as you chant, you'll believe me, because the result will be there. There is no difficulty. But if you say: "No, I shall not chant," then, then you suffer. What can be done? Anyone can chant. The child chants. If you say: "I don't believe in it. I cannot chant it." So many words. And Hare Kṛṣṇa, two words. You take so much trouble. "I cannot chant. I don't believe in it." And Hare Kṛṣṇa, two words. So it is whose fault? I say: "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." If you say, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," immediately, the belief begins. And if you say: "No, no, I cannot chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> I don't believe in it." What can be done? That, that will be taken as misfortune. He's being requested to chant two words. Instead of two words, he'll repeat twenty words. But due to his misfortune, he'll not chant these two words. That is a misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes. But isn't there something else beyond just the chanting? I mean is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the beginning. Then there are many things, ocean. <span class="Italic">Ānandāmbudhi. Ānandāmbudhi</span> means ocean of blissfulness. So come to the shore, touch the water. First of all. Pacific Ocean. Then gradually you understand. If you remain aloof, "No, I shall not touch," then how you can understand what is Pacific Ocean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, I can see that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ambudhi. Ambudhi</span> means ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Means...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic">Ānandāmbudhi. Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam. Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam,<br class="calibre2"/>ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtāsvādanaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>(sarvātma-snapanaṁ) paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa(-saṅkīrtanam)<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Cc. Antya 20.12]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Sarvātma-snapanaṁ paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam. If you chant, then, behind the chanting there are so many things. First thing is <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam,</span> cleansing the heart. All disease are due to unclean heart. Disease means uncleanness. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So our material disease means unclean heart. So we have to cleanse the heart. And this is the process. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.</span> You are Swedish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, I'm Swede. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you can speak English very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> I lived in South America for about five years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Johannesburg. What is called? South America. Oh, South Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> South America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, Johannesburg, South Africa. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You lived in South America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> In Brazil, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Brazil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> And I went to an English school there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our temple in Mexico.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And in Caracas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Caracas also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caracas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> And Trinidad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Trinidad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> When did this movement start in the western hemisphere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> 1966, in New York City. The teachings are standard, the teachings of this movement are standard, coming down from the original source, Kṛṣṇa, the original speaker. So it is very scientific. It's not manufactured. Today's science... Just like psychoanalysis, so many things, they are created recently. And so there are so many experiments and theories changing every day. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is different in that it is the standard science for understanding the self. It's been practiced for hundreds, thousands, thousands years. And it has been proved successful by the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> or the saintly teachers. So the same thing which was practiced many, many hundreds and thousands of years ago is being practiced today, and the same result is being achieved. This is the difference between Kṛṣṇa consciousness and..., Kṛṣṇa conscious science, spiritual science, and material science. The spiritual science requires no speculation or experimentation. But one has to accept it from the right, the authorized source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes. And it was that point I was taking up here, that for some people, accepting things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Everyone has to accept some, somebody. They either accept you or their mother, their father, somebody. At every moment, some, someone has to be accepted as authority for something. So what is the best authority? This should be the question. If I have to accept some authority, either here or there, then which is the best authority? This should be the point. Are you the best authority or this man or this man or this man...? Or who should be the best authority? The best authority is that authority which is perfect. That is God. God is perfect. So this is our, our, this is the foundation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that God, He is perfect. Whatever He gives as instruction, that should be accepted. But if we don't agree to that, then we have to take instruction from someone else. And that is bound to be imperfect. Isn't it? Because we are working with imperfect senses, seeing, hearing. So whatever our conclusions may be, they're going to imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it has began from imperfect. Therefore conclusion must be imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if we begin from the perfect, the conclusion will be perfect. What are the four defects? Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Uh, four de... Every conditioned soul, you or I, anyone, born in this material world, he's defective by four things. He has got imperfect senses. Just like you don't see what's happening beyond the wall. So this is imperfection of the senses. There are so many examples. The next thing is you're subjected to be illusioned. You may accept a thing for real which is not real. Just like we accept the body as self, but we are not the body. The body is a lump of matter. We are simply witnessing the changes of the body, but we are not the... So this is illusion. Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mistakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He's subjected to make mistakes. He'll make a mistake. Everybody knows. To err is human, right? And he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Has a propensity for cheating. Propensity for cheating means that although he's imperfect senses, subject to make mistake and he's illusioned, he will write books giving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Instructions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Instructions. Because... But he's not qualified. So he's cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> He's cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> He's also cheating himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Cheating himself and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cheating others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> ...cheating others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is going on. Recently it happened in Los Angeles, one big professor came to lecture there, and he has got Nobel Prize. I forgot his name. He has written one book, Chemical Evolution. So he was speaking on that Chemical Evolution, and his theory is life begins from four chemicals. So he gave lectures. After that, there is one student. He's also Doctor in Chemistry. He's my disciple. So he asked that professor that: "If I give you the chemicals, will you be able to produce life?" He replied: "That I cannot say." He says that life begins from these four chemicals. And he lectured hours. And when he was asked: "Suppose I give you these four chemicals, will you be able to produce life?" He answered, "That I cannot say." Just see. Is it not cheating? He's, he's saying that life is produced from these chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when he's offered these chemicals, he's not certain whether he'll be able to produce life. Is it not cheating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, he's jumping to conclusions, one can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> He's jumping to conclusions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, he's not certain about producing life from those chemicals. But still he's lecturing. Is it not cheating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Not cheating, no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is. Because he cannot produce life. Actually, he cannot, but he's lecturing on this basis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But he has produced four stages of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ehh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Not real life, but the proteins that life is made of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are concerned with the real life. We are consider, concerned with the real life. If you can produce one real life, a small ant, not human being, then I shall think that you are successful in your program. But that you cannot do. Why do you talk nonsense? Therefore you are cheating. Why should he say: "That I cannot say," if he's not confident. That means cheating. Everyone is doing that. He's not confident about his theory, and he's speaking long, long speech. And people are fools. They are hearing. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> One blind man is leading many blind man. What is the benefit? The leader has no eyes, and he's leading many blind men. What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Hmm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And these so-called scientists will reply: "Yes, we are trying. In future..." In future, everyone can expect future. But the hearsay is that: "Trust no future, however pleasant." Why future? In past we could not do. At present we cannot not do. What is the guarantee that in future we'll be able to do? There is no history that anyone has produced life from chemicals. What do your, what do you think, that life is a product of chemicals? Do you mean to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> That is what I've been taught. Yes. About the evolution of the earth. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> ...all the different stages of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think that's a fact...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> It's not a fact. I don't know whether it's a fact. I... But that's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that means illusioned. You are not confident, but you accept that theory. This is illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But... Yes. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you should apply your reason, from practical life, whether life is produced from matter, or matter is produced from life. Our proposition is: matter is produced from life, not life is produced from matter. In the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> it is said: <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> Absolute Truth is that from whom or from which everything emanates. Now that Absolute Truth, whether he's life or dead stone. So that is discussed: <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ [SB </span>1.1.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That Absolute Truth must be cognizant. So as soon as you say cognizant, then He's alive. <span class="Italic">Abhijñaḥ.</span> That, that means if I say: "I have produced all these things that is within the room," then means I must have brain. I must be experienced how to do it. How I can be dead, matter? Has the matter has got such thing? The origin of creation must be a living being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But somewhere... If I can... But in this, there is also the creation of life, when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that evidence, creation of life from matter? Is there any evidence in the history?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> No, but as we know, the evolution of life has gone through different stages of... How do you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Darwin's theory. Do you mean to say, Darwin's theory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense. Darwin was a number-one nonsense. Yes. Rascal. He has confused the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Hmm. Why...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Evolution of matter. Matter cannot evolve. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But evolution of life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that life? That is different from matter. That is a different energy. That I am speaking. Matter is... Life is the origin of matter. The evolution is not of the matter, but of the life. That Darwin does not know. Therefore I say nonsense. He does not know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes. But I feel in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like this is an apartment. So from this apartment, you go to another apartment. So it does not mean that this apartment has evolved to that apartment. I, the person, I create that apartment, or I prefer that apartment. Not that this apartment has evolved into that apartment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, I can see what you mean. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Darwin's nonsense is there. He is changing the apartment. Apartment is becoming a different apartment. That is not a fact. Just try to understand. This room cannot develop into another room. But I, the resident of this room, I can go from this apartment to another apartment. Or I can create another apartment. This is evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> And I can create a bigger apartment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, bigger, smaller, as I like. Not necessarily bigger. That is also another nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> And my intelligence might grow also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intelligence, maybe. But there must be means. You may be very intelligent, but if you have no means to erect another nice apartment, how it will?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Trial and error.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Trial and error.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you have got the desire to purchase another dress, garment, nicer, but if you have no money, then how you can purchase? You have to purchase something inferior. So these different species of life is the evolution of the living soul according to his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> That is Vedic instruction. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> So I am a living entity. If I want to go to better condition of life, then I'll have to pay for it. Better condition is there already. Not this inferior condition changes into that better condition. That is another thing. Just like the condition in moon planet is different from the condition of this earthly planet. That is already there. You have to transfer yourself from this planet to that planet. So that point is missing in Darwin's theory. He says that body is evolving. That is nonsense. The body is evolving, then why the monkey body is not producing a human body at the present moment? Where is the evidence? The monkeys are already there. Where is the evidence in the zoo that a monkey has produced a human being? Do you think it is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, that, that life might have taken different forms, that I'm quite sure of. And that the human being might not have existed for about a hundred thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No human beings exists eternal. He's existing. But he accepting, he's accepting different situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> There's proof of this in that recently there was a discovery in South America. I think it was in Kenya. Where they discovered a skeletal remains that were over hundreds of thousands of years old that was pre, what is it? Mag... What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Cro-magnon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Cro-magnon, and it was the same human body as now, as we have now. They have discovered. And with this discovery, they say, completely all of Darwin's theories have been destroyed. This is a fact. Immediately see. He overlooked. He says: "I do not see any proof that human beings lived, millions of years ago. Therefore I think apes were existing." But what proof does he have? And how they have discovered bones and they have proven by tests that Cro-magnon era there was the same human body. It's a fact. And completely his, all his theories have been destroyed. Because he again, he was working with his illusory senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Hmm. But there are the dinosaurs for example. The dinosaurs, yes. Which died and disappeared from the earth. And that is also a kind of evolution that has taken place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He says there are these prehistoric animals like dinosaurs, these big, gigantic animals, they are no longer existing now, but they existed at one time. So there, there was some evolution there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But the point is Vedic, Vedic conclusion is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but, apart from Vedic conclusion, this example, that practically, when I go from this apartment to another apartment, so this apartment does not become another apartment. I go from this apartment to another apartment. He's missing that "I". Or "you". That is his nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> He's only talking about apartments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is his rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, I can see what you mean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not know. The apartment does not change. The owner of the apartment goes from one apartment to another. That he does not know. Therefore he's cheating. He does not, he has no perfect knowledge, and he's cheating. Cheater. He does not know. The soul, from the monkey's body is coming to human body. That is nice. Not that the monkey's body is changing into human body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But some of this cheating, as you call it, must have, have still been a great use to mankind because it has not been proven at the time when this theory has been evoked by some scientist, it has not been proven that he's right, but he works according to this principle that he has got, and then later...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That, that is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> that in the jungle one big animal is the leader of other animals. That's all. But they're animals. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But I don't really understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the jungle, in the forest,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the lion is considered to be the king of animals. So lion is also animal, only big animal. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> So you mean the scientist is a big lion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. A big rascal. That's it. A big rascal. A big rascal is eulogized by small rascals. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Seducing a small rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Seducing a small rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another small rascal. This is the position. Everything is going on like that. Not only in science, philosophy, religion, sociology, politics. The, a big rascal and small rascal. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But you must evoke quite a lot of feelings when you say, for example, that Einstein was a very big rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He believed in God. Yes. He believed in God. He was not a rascal. A sane man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Carl Jung also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He believed in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He tried to find out the brain of God. So he's not rascal. He's sane man. Those who are defying God, they're rascal, demons. Einstein believed in God. Yes. There are many scientists, they believe in God. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto...</span> Unless one is God conscious, he's a rascal. Immediately, take it. We take it like that. As soon as you say godless, atheist, oh, a rascal. That's all. It may be the understanding of God is not so perfect. But he thinks there is God. That is intelligence. That is intelligence. And the demons will never accept God. Just like in Russia. All set of rascals. They do not believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But the interest... The religious interest in Russia is, is greater than in any other country in Europe. But not the, the leaders are not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I say the leaders. Not only in Russia. Everywhere. The leaders, the rascal leaders spoiling the whole world situation. In India also. In India, by nature, they are aloof from these four principles of sinful life. Eighty percent of the population, by nature. But government, at the present moment, the leaders, they're inducing them to eat meat, to drink. And gambling also. Introducing. Gambling. Government is issuing that gambling cards. Because government means some rascal just like Nixon has gone to the power. Now he's proved he's a rascal. So everywhere the government leaders means all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Although Nixon says, in every television speech, that he is a God believer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Nixon says, at least, that he is a God believer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe God believer, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Are you leaving for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Six-ten. We leave in ten, fifteen minutes. Would you care to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> No, I have to go back to my, to this emergency ward. One of my colleagues was, were ill today, and I had to replace him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> As far as Nixon is concerned, we can see from his activities that he may say that he's a believer in God, but his actions prove contrary. You see, that's... You see you can judge a person by his activities. With someone like Śrīla Prabhupāda, you can judge that actually he is the only person I have ever met within my short span who is actually... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> ...I was also thinking that it was a little bit hard for me to get into the language or the Indian words. And I felt that one has to be rather intellectually sharp to be able to go into these matters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that difficult word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Intellectually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that difficult word? You are feeling difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The Indian words means Sanskrit words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Sanskrit word we have given English equivalents. So what is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> It's not that, it's not that... I can understand them but... and I can get the translations and... but then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have given the equivalent of each word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then translation and then purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> No, but what I mean to say is that this is knowledge that can be spread in this way, it must be spread to people who are rather accustomed to reading, to getting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If he reads he will be accustomed. Reading will make him accustomed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Well the reading customs, for example, in Sweden are very, you know, very limited to newspapers and television and it will take them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we have explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yeah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have explained. Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">tad-vāg-visargo janatāgha-viplavaḥ.</span> Yes, first of all you see the index?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> What this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yellow book, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> First Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Tad-vāg-visargo janatāgha-viplavaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> (reads verse and translation, S.B. 1.5.11)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> (reads the translation again)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The newspaper is glorification of this mundane world. You have to transfer your consciousness to understand the glorification of the Supreme. This is transcendental literature. So people have got the tendency to read but they're glorifying this rascal, mundane rascals. So that attitude should be transferred to understand the glorification of the Supreme Lord. That will be (indistinct). That we are presenting. We are presenting a literature exactly like the newspaper. They are glorifying some Nixon and Dixon. We are glorifying Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference. That is the difference. If Nixon has glorification, how much glorification is there in reserve of the Supreme Lord?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> But these Nixons and Dixons and Hitlers and... They have a rather...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is illusion. We are attached to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Yes, we are attached to them also because they have power over us. They can persecute us and they can... So it's very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the greater power is Kṛṣṇa. If you take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, they cannot do anything. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja, he was a five years old boy. He took shelter of Kṛṣṇa and his father was a great demon, very powerful. He wanted to chastise his boy. He could not. This is the proof. So you take shelter. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pape...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. "I give you protection." So people have no faith although He's God. He thinks God is less powerful than Hitler. That is his nonsense. If he takes actually shelter of Kṛṣṇa, what this rascal, Hitler, can do? But he has no faith in God. He thinks Prabhu Hitler is greater than Lord. Prabhu Hitler. That is the difference between the crows and the swans. The crows think that we have got food in the garbage. And the swans think that we have got food in nice garden, in the clear water. And that is difference even in the birds kingdom. That is explained in the previous verse. <span class="Italic">Na yad vacaś citra-padaṁ harer yaśo, jagat-pavitraṁ pragṛṇīta karhicit, tad vāyasaṁ tīrtham </span>[SB 1.5.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> Read that, previous to this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> (reads verse, SB 1.5.10)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> (reads translation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a question of taste. Just see birds, two kinds of birds, crows and the swans, different taste. Therefore we are trying to create taste for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then these crows' place, newspaper, we'll not... We don't read newspaper. We don't touch it unless there is some news of ours. We don't touch it. What is the use of wasting time? They read so big, big bundle of newspaper. But we don't touch them. Oh, we have got (indistinct) literature here. Why should we waste our time in the crows' manifestation? The same politics, same Nixon, same Dixon, same Hitler. It is called <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">,</span> chewing the chewed. Things which have already been chewed and thrown away, another person is crying, "Let me see if there's any juice." But you have already chewed. What juice you find there? <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">,</span> again and again, same politics, same new leader, same he's a rascal. Just like Nixon advertises in news, "America now requires Nixon." So America accepted him and now America doesn't want him. Again another Nixon will come. This is going on, <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaḥ,</span> again and again, chewing the chewed. The people are not disgusted but we have tasted all these rascals. Why another Nixon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> There doesn't seem to be any accumulation of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no brain. The same thing, the crows. So therefore they have to be enlightened to Kṛṣṇa consciousness then they will be able to find out some big leader, nice leader for them. There are so many things. You are educated. You should try to understand our philosophy. There are so many things to be learned from our... They're not sentimentally dancers only. They've got logic, philosophy, science, everything. Otherwise how we are writing so many books? Just see, ancient word, how they are nicely, these two verses we have read. How full of meaning. <span class="Italic">Na yad vacaś citra-padaṁ harer yaśo. Harer, pragṛṇīta karhicit, tad vāyasaṁ tīrtham </span>[SB 1.5.10]<span class="Italic">,</span> each word has volumes of meanings. There are 18,000 verses in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And each word you'll find enlivening. Each word. It's such a nice literature. One verse contains actually sixteen words. So 18,000 multiplied by sixteen, how much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> 18,000...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 18,000 verses multiplied by sixteen. How many words?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> 280,000. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 280,000 words and each word you'll find a new light. That is (indistinct). Each word you'll find.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Are these going to be translated into Swedish too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if you do. (laughter) We have got the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some Sanskrit scholar in Swedish language must come forward. Then it can be done. But he must be a good scholar because each word is meaningful. Yes. Just like beginning of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, janmādy asya [SB 1.1.1]. Janmādi.</span> So this one word has volumes of meaning. <span class="Italic">Janmādi</span> means beginning from <span class="Italic">janma.</span> So beginning from <span class="Italic">janma,</span> but, how many things are there? Generally, birth <span class="Italic">janmastiti lat</span>(?), birth, then you stay for some time and then you become vanquished. This body. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya [SB 1.1.1]. Asya</span> of this material world. <span class="Italic">Janma,</span> creation, then situation, then annihilation. Now how many volumes of books you can write on these three words? How this universe was created? How it is being maintained and how it will be annihilated? These three words. How many books you can write?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Infinity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> verse, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya [SB 1.1.1], asya janmādi</span> (indistinct) concise word but volumes of meanings. Volumes. Each word is like that. <span class="Italic">Vidyā bhāgavata-vali</span>(?). Therefore one's learning is complete when he reads <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Otherwise he remains imperfect, in spite of all learning. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> from where? Now the creation of this cosmic world, from where? But you do not know from where. This is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam. Paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi.</span> That is actually true. In this way simply if you analyze one verse, you'll find each word is full of volumes of meaning. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ, anvayāt [SB 1.1.1].</span> Like the creation, <span class="Italic">anvayāt,</span> directly and indirectly, <span class="Italic">itarataś cārtheṣu,</span> in the matter of understanding, <span class="Italic">abhijñaḥ. Abhijñaḥ</span> means completely cognizant. That is the Absolute Truth. He knows everything-how this universe is created, how it is maintained, how it annihilated, directly and indirectly. Just like, I always, regular, everyday thing, when I am massaged by my student, I see so many veins so I think that I claim, "This is my leg," but I do not know what are these veins. Directly I know this is my leg, but indirectly I do not know how this leg is working with these veins and nerves and muscles. I do not know. But so far God is concerned, He has created. He knows every veins and everything. That is called <span class="Italic">abhijñaḥ.</span> In this way you analyze every word, you'll find volumes of meaning. The next question, "Where you got this experience?" You say He's <span class="Italic">abhijñaḥ,</span> He knows everything. To get experience one must have teacher. But the next word is <span class="Italic">svarāṭ,</span> He's experienced and self-sufficiency, <span class="Italic">svarāṭ,</span> independent. He hasn't got to go anywhere for experiencing. In this way each word is full of meaning. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ, anvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ, tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> We have very shortly described this one verse. I think five, six pages. You've got that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes. Right here. (showing book to the psychiatrist) Here's the translation, the verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very short description.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Short. (laughs) ...for the next verse also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is so meaningful. All learned scholars of the world must read <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> if they want to actually good for themselves and good for the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> (indistinct) if we can leave at seven o'clock, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you say, I leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It's seven o'clock now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> It's seven now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I have five minutes to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Why don't you come with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> I can't. I'm very sorry but I would have very much liked to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Tomorrow morning Śrīla Prabhupāda's leaving at 8:30, if you'd like to come. He has a morning walk at six o'clock if you'd like to come for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Before I leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not so important. Nobody can rise at six o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Well, I can sometimes. It has been a pleasure meeting you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, thank you very much for your time also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Hauser:</span> Thank you. (end)</div>
