<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...for others it is said. For Kṛṣṇa, it is mercy. The <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> came with lust. They became purified with Kṛṣṇa's association. <span class="Italic">Gopīs</span> actually, superficially, externally, they are, means, <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha,</span> ever-liberated expansion of Kṛṣṇa's energy, internal energy. But apparently, they left their father, husband and came to Kṛṣṇa. So that is, from Vedic principle, it is wrong. One young girl cannot go to other young man, giving up the protection of father, brother, and... So they did it. So they, according to Vedic principle, it is sinful. But because it was related with Kṛṣṇa, they became purified. That means any way, if one comes in contact with Kṛṣṇa, he becomes purified. Even though he's sinful. That is Kṛṣṇa's... That is the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sun is never infected. Rather, the infected area becomes sterilized by the sunshine. This is the process. That is explained. <span class="Italic">Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.33.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who is very powerful, he has no fault. So how your temperature is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Everything is getting very nicely improved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You've got some cold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I got everything, still, I haven't got anything. (laughter) So you can invite the neighboring people. We can hold an evening class or morning class. I'll give you one matter for... [break] This is a nice place. If you invite the neighboring..., they may come and take advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It looks like an American neighborhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It looks like an American neighborhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is very nice place. So you are also helping Tejas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Tomorrow morning I'm meeting with Indira Gandhi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...and the American ambassador.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If Indira Gandhi comes one day...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We're thinking if we can get either one of those two, then everyone else will come very easily. They'll give money, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. It is very nice. Indira Gandhi knows our movement. Is it not? Yes, she knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. I approached her that you are the great, the greatest emissary of Kṛṣṇa, of Indian culture outside of India. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. But these rascals do not appreciate it. Others are appreciating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The foreign countries, they're appreciating, "Here is real Indian culture." They should also appreciate by the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes, that's the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By the result, not theoretical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> No. So we were showing pictures and books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Every sane man should appreciate. When European and American young men, who are after material sense gratification, they're taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> it is not joke. They should appreciate it. In an age where material sense enjoyment is very prominent, and they give up everything for Kṛṣṇa, and they're going far away from their comfortable position... Just like Brahmānanda has gone to Africa. So what for? Unless they appreciate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, how they take up this job? This is practical. There is no question of theoretical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You said that last night when you spoke that about we are actually <span class="Italic">siddhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> We are not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I wanted to prove... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that these boys are <span class="Italic">siddhas.</span> Others, they do not know what is <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They have not even left family connection, you said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That I... That Mr. Kokoor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...talking high talks. Simply high words will not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think, I think it will be good, though, if we flatter Mrs. Gandhi also, a little flattery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Let her think that we are praising her leadership of the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yes, flatter that "You can say that you'll be glorified when India will be glorified. So this culture will glorify India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "And Prabhupāda has introduced."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It is now already...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "So you should cooperate with us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "This is India's original culture, Kṛṣṇa culture." And ninety-percent of the people, they are Kṛṣṇa devotees, of India. There is no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... And this has got the potency of being spread all over the world. All over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Hm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some news has come out in <span class="Italic">Jugantar</span> that Queen Elizabeth is reading our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> That was from that time David Wynne gave her that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...to read while she was sitting for him for the sculpture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it has come to her attention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think he has told that story to several people and the word has spread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Where did you hear it from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, that, our, our architect, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Surabhi. Oh, Mr. Lahiri.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has seen in the <span class="Italic">Jugantar Press.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It was in the newspaper here in India. (laughter) She did! She read it one day for three hours, four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You're kidding!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the latest report is that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is selling fifteen thousand copies per month in London. Who told me? Thirty-thousand copies sold in two months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It was MacMillan's biggest selling book in England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That also you can inform her. And present her one copy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One copy of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I gave her one copy of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who arranged this meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, we did. We just went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And with the American Ambassador, we have left him today one copy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And tomorrow we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can refer that Mr., what is his, last ambassador?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Keath, Keating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes, I already have given him one copy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows us very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that...? He gave us some letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We gave already that copy to the ambassador.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He liked this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Also I gave the papers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And "We are American. You can ask about this movement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes, I said that also. I said, "Because most of your disciples are American, and you are an American practically..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Ah. "So you can test us. You can test us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Also politically speaking, now it is time Mrs., Mrs. Gandhi is being criticized now by Hindus because she took sides with these Arabs during this war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. She is very highly criticized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So she needs to get some political benefit from associating with Hindus during some functions just now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That will counteract.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> "And also he needs that association with India leaders. Because America is..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If she comes, then we shall have to give a nice speech so that she may be convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. Very flatter... I think, I think we should flatter her completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> No controversy. And this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that, "If you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, naturally everything will be correct." Just like Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja was Kṛṣṇa conscious. And can, you can read the portion during the reign of Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja, how nature was helping. <span class="Italic">Kāmaṁ vavarṣa.</span> You keep one set of books here. <span class="Italic">Kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ [SB </span>1.10.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Due to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's being Kṛṣṇa conscious, everything was going on nicely. So by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, you are on the post of Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja. So if you take standard, it will be good for everyone. And so far secular state is concerned, we are actually secular. In this movement, all classes of men are here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you'll have to preach to her. Because she won't listen to... If I can just get her to agree to be the chief guest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And accept the book. That is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> That's all I can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> If you preach to her, she'll listen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> But she won't listen if I preach to her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is not possible. That I know. You simply try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Induce her to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, to join us at least one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And accept the book, read it, at least the introductory portion, preface portion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I can show her politically how it would be advantageous for her to come. That much I can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I, I... I don't think you should advise him, her...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I mean I don't need to really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...about politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> She knows it. She knows that you... And also this American ambassador could use some favorable publicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> contains everything-politics, sociology, religion, philosophy. So this culture should be spread; this India's culture, original culture, should be spread. And we are endeavoring that. And it is becoming successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Also we are meeting the Minister of Defence, Jagjivana Rama. And Dr. Karan Singh is coming back on Monday. He's been out. And Kumar Shankara Diksit tomorrow morning also, the Minister of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kumar Shankara Diksit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...Home Affairs. Minister of Home Affairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Big post.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, these politicians are politicians. Anyway, we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> At least, if they come, everything will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indira, simply Indira Gandhi comes, it will be tremendous success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. Crowds will come. People will donate money for the <span class="Italic">pandala.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when the <span class="Italic">pandala</span> will be erected?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> It will begin on the fourth, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It will begin on the fourth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That place is nice, but it is not as public as the L.I.C.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> We need some... For that reason, we need some very good chief guest and some good publicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We arranged some newspaper publicity today. So... And he's arranged banners and posters and... Enough people will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got some fruits?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Mostly, I think they'll come because they remember before, when you were here... [break] (end)</div>
