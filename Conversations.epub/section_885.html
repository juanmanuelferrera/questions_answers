<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...point out material development of civilization is artificial. It is not meant for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is patchwork.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India has been frustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> you mention in the First Canto how it was predicted that certain different peoples, they would conquer India. This was predicted in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span>. So these troubles they were foreseeing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The troubles that India is going through today, they were foreseeing over five thousand years ago, that the Muslims would invade, the Turks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The Englishman would invade. That is also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Greeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the Twelfth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I think Candragupta's name is also.... The last emperor of India. [break] ...fighting between the demons and the demigods, the demons brought mountain and it was in fire, the jungle, and it was split by dynamite, and all the stones fell down on the enemies. Where is that war plan? Bring the mountain on the head of the enemies and split it by dynamite, and it will.... [break] This information is there, that dynamite was there, and it was used for breaking mountain. Fighting was taking place. Not in this planet, upper planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is in connection with the churning of the ocean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it actually possible for the demons to win?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes. When there is fighting, both the parties will have chance to win. What is this? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...degraded activity in the public parks. Fighting and intoxications and all kinds of nonsense. Just like animals. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> And there were so many people that we decided that next weekend we'll come and distribute magazines and incense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Eighteenth Chapter, 54th verse, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">,</span> it says that the person in <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ</span> realization at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. If the devotee is situated on the platform of the <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> but he may not necessarily see everything as Brahman, does that mean that his realization is by intelligence, and by his activity, or what does that mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Realization of spiritual identification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> Realization of spiritual life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Identity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> Identity? [break] Brahman realization for the devotee in the beginning is just that he realizes his constitutional position as servant of Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is next. First of all, that "I am not this body." That is Brahman realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> So we may only be partially situated in that realization in our present level of devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You realize or not realize, if you remain on the platform, that is same. [break] ...in Kṛṣṇa's service, that is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ</span> stage. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> ...says that such a person never laments nor desires anything. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you realize that you are servant of Kṛṣṇa, where is lamentation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> Due to <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> influence, a devotee may sometimes materially lament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to struggle. <span class="Italic">Tapasā brahmacāryeṇa [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> But if you stick to devotional service, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will not be able to touch you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> The <span class="Italic">māyā</span> that harasses the devotee is just mental concoction, then? He should concentrate on just serving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā</span>'s harassing, that means you are not in devotional service. It is not concoction; it is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (indistinct) We're having a lot of trouble distributing books in the airports now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It just seems legal problems. People don't like us there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> People are opposing more. As our movement grows more and more, people want to check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...trying to get it open in the terminals, and there's a possibility of maybe getting forty devotees inside the airport to distribute your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, that is favorable. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> ...so powerful, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that all over the country young men are running away from home. We have one fifteen-year-old boy, he left everything after getting a book in a parking lot. Another boy is a sculptor, an artist. He's also runaway, seventeen years old. Just like Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, once he was attracted by Lord Caitanya's movement, nothing could keep him at home. So all the young men of America, as they read your books, will come and join us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our books are prescribed as textbook in Hamburg University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eastern Berlin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> East Berlin. As Sanskrit text.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? When we're distributing on this program, we go to very small towns where people are not very much exposed to the degradedness of the big cities, and we're having great success with the people because they are a little more innocent. But we're having a problem with this other group that goes around, and they do <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> just like us, but for <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And then when we go in the parking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They chant Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, that is not possible. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> They'll not last.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But Śrīla Prabhupāda, they mistake us. When we go up and approach them with our books, they think, "Oh, you are this rascal." They know he's a cheater. And it's causing a lot of difficulty with our distribution. I was just wondering what we can do about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This Moon group?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Moon, yes. Interfering with some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Preaching is never easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Prabhupāda said on one tape that.... Somebody said it was difficulty. He said, "When there's fighting, you can't expect it to be easy." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> There are many different levels of pure devotional service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pure devotional service is one. So long you are not on the pure platform, there are many. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> ...between the neophyte devotee who is following the principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neophyte devotee is not on the topmost platform. He's learning. (loud foghorn blowing in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> So a neophyte devotee who's following the principles of <span class="Italic">sādhana-bhakti</span> is still considered pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> So at different levels of advancement of pure devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Prabhupāda once gave the example of a mango, that when the mango is raw, it's still a mango. Then it becomes ripe-also a mango. So pure devotional service is different when we begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So raw condition and ripe condition is not the same. The mango is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The captain of that boat must know that you're here on the island today, because those whistles that he just blew were salutes. It's a master salute from the best man to the best man. He must know that you are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya! Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> In the Sixth Canto of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> you made a statement that if a devotee chants the holy name even once inoffensively, this protects him eternally. Is it possible for a devotee...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you take advantage of chants one only? Why not sixteen? Opportunist. (laughter) Not devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> If one has even a small amount...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This material calculation is not made by a devotee. When one is devotee, he'll chant more and more. He'll aspire, "If I could get millions of tongues and trillions of ear, then I could finish. That is devotee. And one is thinking how to finish it by chanting once, he's not devotee. That is neophyte stage. Therefore the regulation is you must chant sixteen rounds at least. Because he'll simply try to avoid it by his so-called intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> It's possible for even a neophyte to chant offenselessly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not possible, but he has to do it. This is offense, to think that "I have chanted once; my all sinful activities are now neutralized." This is offense. <span class="Italic">Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.</span> This is the offense. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> Chanting, following the orders of the spiritual master...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. No calculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> Is that considered offenseless chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Yes. You follow strictly the instructions. If you commit offense, how it is offenseless?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> It's considered offenseless if, chanting, if one follows the orders of the spiritual master carefully?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There may be offense. You should go on chanting. That will be adjusted as you advance in chanting. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma, harer nāma eva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply go on chanting. We shall see later on what is offense and not offense. (laughter) Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> not for any profit. But go on serving Him. That's all. Material calculation, "Now, this much I have profited..." [break] .... there is no animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This jungle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are some deers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes. Yes. I just saw a raccoon just now when I was getting the car. There are some in there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no monkey?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> (laughter) No. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No monkey in the United States. [break] "Nature Center" it says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> You know what that is, Ambarīṣa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, I don't know. I have no idea. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...monkey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's a bit odd. They're busy building new attractions for the park, but they can't even keep the place clean. Everything is completely dirty and run down. No one will want to come anyway. They do that, though. They have a certain amount of things that they construct new so that the people will be thinking, "Oh, our taxes have been spent for our benefit like this." It's to make a show. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is Canada?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, this side over here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Way over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Detroit Yacht Club. Boat owners. [break] ...by some Catholic monks who were keeping some drug rehabilitation. They were leasing it from us. We still have a lease to the owner. So they are subleasing it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to stop drug habit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. They have.... People who are addicted, they come and live there voluntarily and say "I'd like to try to stop." They call it "half-way house," because they are half still addicted, but they're trying to stop. So maybe six of such addicts are living...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, not many. Here's the place, right here. And some monks live there, and somehow or other they try to get them to stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which year I came first? Bhagavān was in charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> I think it was six years ago from last year. So that would be '69.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At that time I'll see, here is the signboard "For Sale."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Same one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No one is purchasing. Why? Suggested Bhagavān that "Why don't you purchase this land?" I see the same signboard is still going on (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Nobody wants to buy property on this street. It's very dangerous and rundown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, in that quarter where we have got our temple, the same position. Therefore we got cheap. (laughs) Otherwise, it is very costly building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We did not even want to take you down there last year to see it. We thought it is out of the question. And you said, "There's nothing to be afraid of. Just hold <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. People are coming. Yesterday many gentlemen. Gradually you purchase that side land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we had so many people yesterday. We had about two hundred people in the temple room and three hundred people outside waiting in line for <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They were all wandering around the grounds. It was very pleasant. So many people taking here and there, preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That house is exactly suitable for our purpose in every way. It was Kṛṣṇa's desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even the people that passed on the boat stopped. We preached to them as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> I was thinking, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it would be nice to have dioramas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, give some signboard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then dioramas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> All right. (end)</div>
