<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now he is there also in Los Angeles, our Umāpati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh Umāpati. In Los Angeles, yes. I saw him when I went there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is doing nice there. Now he's <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> He has got a job in Spiritual Sky. So he is now steady. The Spiritual Sky is doing one thing, that providing so many <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Some activity for them to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Karandhara is managing very nicely, giving them some pocket expense. And instead of renting elsewhere, they are tenant of our house. So we have got tenants, but no trouble from the tenants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. When it was suggested that I purchase house, I said that "I am not going to have this tenants' trouble. That is very botheration." So Karandhara suggested that "We have got our own tenants. Why they should stay in other apartment house? If we have got our house, they will stay, and there will be no trouble." "Then it is all right." They require house. So all <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> they have got separate apartment, living very peacefully. So anyway, every one of us should observe strictly the regulative principles and serve sincerely. Kṛṣṇa will help us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> In Calcutta we're approaching all of the libraries. At least twenty-five libraries have ordered your books, complete sets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you see, anywhere we can approach. I sold in Bombay all libraries, my previous <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> About Ten or twelve books, each bill is about five hundred rupees times twenty-five. That's a lot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is a respect, if the libraries and schools, colleges, they keep our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Some of them are shocked. We went to the National Library in Calcutta. That's the largest library. They saw your books and they said, "Oh, he is doing this work?" They were so impressed. They had never seen Sanskrit or Bengali printed in foreign countries the way you have done in your books. They said, "This is fan..." There's no one else who is doing this in India, no one. Very impressed. And these men themselves are Sanskrit scholars. He immediately started to read. He said, "Oh, very nice." He said, "It is just right." So he was very enthusiastic. There are two boys. They spend the whole day just going to libraries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That has been written by Professor Dayal, Dimock, that "Sanskrit scholars should get good opportunity, and nobody, I think, will deny Swamiji's scholarship." He has said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Any name we have in India, any good name we have, is due to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) It is due to Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī. Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you can give me massage. Thank you very much. Now you have got very, very great responsible work. I will die. You will live. <span class="Italic">Kīrtir yasya sa jīvati.</span> But I will not die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, you could never die. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We can't accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We refuse to accept that. (end)</div>
