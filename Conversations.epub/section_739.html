<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> Someone had mentioned that we should start up in Bihar and come down into Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think if they go to Orissa it will be nice? No? The <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Orissa will be nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you talk with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāvānanda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> ...say to me what do I think of Pāgal Bābā? And I would say, "Well, our <span class="Italic">Guru Mahārāja</span> does not approve of us smoking cigarettes." And they will say, "But he smokes cigarettes." And I would say, "That is because he is <span class="Italic">pāgal.</span>" And they would agree. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These four principles will make so many bogus <span class="Italic">bābās</span> as useless, simply if you follow these four principles. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> ...that Rāmacandra ate meat. Some people have said to me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmacandra can eat you and the whole universe. (laughter) Can you do that? By... Even Rāmacandra used to eat meat, so you can simply imitate for meat-eating. But why don't you imitate how to construct a bridge over the ocean? Why don't you say that Rāmacandra constructed a bridge on the ocean. Can you do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it says, <span class="Italic">yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> Whatever the great men do, you must follow in their footsteps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By their instruction, not by their activities. You should follow the instruction, not the activities. Has Kṛṣṇa said anything that "You also act <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā</span> like Me?" Has said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Never.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how you can? These rascals, these <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs,</span> they play <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā.</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">ācarati śreṣṭhas</span> means that <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha</span> is ordinary person, but not Bhagavān. Bhagavān can act any way. And still, Bhagavān has never instructed you that "You imitate Me in raising the Govardhana Hill." Has He said like that, that "You also raise the Govardhana Hill like Me"? [break] ...orders <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto ṁad-yājī mām.</span> That is for you. Always think of Him. Always become His devotee. Worship Him. Offer your obeisances. That's all. That is for you. Yasodamayi was asking Kṛṣṇa, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, can you bring the slipper of Your father?" He could not. He was a small child. Still, with great difficulty He could raise that. But the person who can raise the Govardhana Hill, He was feeling difficulty to raise the slipper? Why? If at that time He becomes like Govardhana, Giridhārī, then the <span class="Italic">līlā</span> between father and son will be damaged. He plays just like a child. Although He can raise even in that age, to raise the hill. One should understand Kṛṣṇa. Everyone compares Him with ordinary man: "Kṛṣṇa has done this? Then I shall do." Kṛṣṇa has done so many other things. Why don't you do it? This rascal... Anyone who imitates Kṛṣṇa on the plea that "Kṛṣṇa has played this; therefore we shall do." He can do anything. He can eat meat and He can eat the whole universe. That was shown to His mother: "Mother, you are angry because I have eaten dirt. Now see within My mouth the whole universe is in. So what is the question of dirt and sea and ocean? I can eat everything." [break] ...<span class="Italic">sam na doṣāya.</span> Just like this sun. It dry up this urine. It is not infected. But you lick up this urine and let us see how powerful you are. <span class="Italic">Tejasaṁ na doṣāya.</span> Who is powerful, he can do anything and everything, whatever he likes. You cannot do that. [break] ...example. This urine, within an hour it will be dried up. How it is dried up? Due to the sun. But the sun is not polluted. But you try to dry up and see the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Wasn't it Lord Rāmacandra's purpose to actually display by His activity how a perfect human being should act?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, I understood that that verse, <span class="Italic">yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">,</span> that was referring to Lord Rāmacandra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is referred, but whatever Rāmacandra says, you should do that. You should not imitate. There are two words: following and imitating. Imitation is not good. Following is good. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati zreṣ...</span> You can... That I have already explained. Can you construct a bridge on the ocean? You are claiming, <i class="calibre3">yad yad acarati</i>. Can you do this? Then why do you say like that? You cannot imitate. You can follow only. "Because Rāmacandra ate meat, so I am eating meat. I become Rāmacandra." And why don't you construct a bridge on the ocean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So actually, perfect kings, they may have eaten meat? Perfect kings...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, perfect king must follow the Vedic injunction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They would never eat meat, even though they are <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> are allowed. That is by hunting, not otherwise. Or <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> Everything is there in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> [break] ...candra, even He was eating meat, is there any instance in the temple Rāmacandra is offered meat? Then why do you claim, "Rāmacandra used to eat meat, therefore I shall eat"? All rascals. Kṛṣṇa, He ate fire, <span class="Italic">khāṇḍava-dāna.</span> But what He asked you to offer? Does He says that "You offer Me fire"? He says, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Does He say that "You give Me fire. I shall eat"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> You mean He eats fire in His representation as the fire-god?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No representation. As He is. He never assumed as fire-god. He was boy and playing, and there was fire and He ate it. That is God, not that He became a fire-god. What is fire-god? Thousands of fire-gods are staying on the nail of His feet. Why He should become a fire-god? <span class="Italic">Mahat-padam.</span> Kṛṣṇa's another name is <span class="Italic">mahat-padam.</span> The whole energy of material world is on His feet. <span class="Italic">Samāsrit ye pada-pallava-plava mahat-pada puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ.</span> So they attend <span class="Italic">maṅgala-arati?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, they do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. [break] ...there are cycles. The cycles are more dangerous than the motor car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Because you can't hear them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, hear... Gives you dash. You see? From the behind. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...God, they do like that. They give this example, "In such and such <span class="Italic">yajña, ṛṣis</span> were eating meat; therefore we shall eat meat." In the Rāmakrishna Mission, <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they say like that. (end)</div>
