<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I do not know why these people protest against me. Kṛṣṇa says, Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says. I do not know what Śaṅkarācārya says, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> When, when <span class="Italic">advaita-darśana</span> was the main doctrine of <span class="Italic">ādi-śaṅkarācārya.</span> So there should not be any <span class="Italic">dvaita</span> between <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That is, from argument, it is all right. Yes. Why one should see <span class="Italic">Brahman</span> and not-<span class="Italic">Brahman?</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> There is only one God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is only one God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Eko brahma dvitīyo nāsti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nāsti.</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Only one God dwells everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya mūrtayaḥ sambha...ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā</span> [Bg. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's the original seed-giving father of all living entities, in any form. So not only human beings, but also animals, birds, beasts. Kṛṣṇa is the original father. <span class="Italic">Jīvera...</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]. And Kṛṣṇa also: <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ [Bg. </span>15.7<span class="Italic">].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why other <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> should be left aside? Why they should not understand Kṛṣṇa. And actually, they are understanding Kṛṣṇa better than many Indians. They have taken very seriously. They do not put any competitor of Kṛṣṇa. Our Hindus, they put forward so many competitors of Kṛṣṇa: "Why Kṛṣṇa shall be God? I have got my own God." Especially after the preaching of this Vivekananda, that "You can create your own God," it has become very simple business to create one God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, then, that time, when Swami Vivekananda went to America, the country was not independent, not liberated. So at that time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Swami Vivekananda, at that time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, who was not liberated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> This country of India. India was not liberated. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what was the connection with liberation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Ne</span>. Because at that time there's some proud of nation and some proud of culture. He wanted to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't think in America there was such conception. America had nothing to do with the British ruling. Rather, they declared independence from British rule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I don't know what was the main idea of Swami Vivekananda at that time, when he preached that, this Vedānta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have read his Chicago speech. In that speech, he openly says, "Why do you care for God? You work hard, and why do you give credit to God?" Like that. Rather, one Christian priest protested...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But many times Swami Vivekananda himself went to temples and bowed down before Kālī, before Śrī Kṛṣṇa, before Śrī Bhavānī, and many other temples. He went to Kanyā-kumārī and prayed before Mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Distribute the <span class="Italic">prasāda. Bhagavān ka prasāda.</span> Hm. That's all. So it is a great pleasure for us. Your Holiness visits us voluntarily. Although I could not invite you, but still, you are so kind, you came. So I am doing my bit, following in the footsteps of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It is a great service to Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and Hindu society and humanity as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are strictly following Vaiṣṇava principles. They... Whenever one comes to become my disciple, the first condition is that no illicit sex; no meat-eating, eggs, fish, nothing of the sort; no intoxication up to smoking cigarette, drinking tea and coffee; and no gambling. So they strictly follow these things. In our society, there is no tea-drinking even. We don't drink tea. So... Intoxication, <span class="Italic">pāna, chāi pāna, pāna... Pāna</span> is intoxication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Tāmbūla...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tāmbūla. Yatra pāpaś catur-vidhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Sanskrit or Hindi: Kṛṣṇa is offered <span class="Italic">tāmbūla</span> in the temple.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. And that <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> of Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...the devotees can take also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> according to our principle... Just like on <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī </span>day, we do not accept even <span class="Italic">prasādam. Anna.</span> We keep it. So <span class="Italic">prasādam...</span> Just like on <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī anna</span> is prohibited, but not the Deity. Deity's offered <span class="Italic">anna,</span> but we cannot take the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> even. So following strictly the principle, even <span class="Italic">tāmbūla</span> is offered to Kṛṣṇa, it is not for us. Yes. Strictly following the principle. The same example... Just like on <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī</span> day, <span class="Italic">anna</span> is offered to Kṛṣṇa, but we don't take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The devotees are not allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not allowed, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I'm very grateful to have your <span class="Italic">darśana. Oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
