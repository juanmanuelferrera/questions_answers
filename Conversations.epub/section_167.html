<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Modern sociology is targeting the state or the people as the owner of a certain state, but our Vedic conception is <span class="Italic">īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ: [Īśo mantra 1]</span> "Everything is owned by <span class="Italic">Īśa,</span> the Supreme Controller." <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā:</span> "What is given by Him, allotted to you, you enjoy that." <span class="Italic">Mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam:</span> "But we not encroach upon others' property." This is <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad, Vedas.</span> And the same idea is explained in different <span class="Italic">Purāṇas.</span> So the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> can give you... The other day I was reading in the, that paper, Moscow News, there was a congress, Communist congress, and the president declared that "We are ready to get others' experience to improve." So I think the Vedic concept of socialism or communism will much improve the idea of communism. Just like we are thinking in terms of human beings, the commu..., socialistic state, that "Nobody should starve. Everyone must have his food." And in the Vedic conception of <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> householder, it is recommended there that a householder shall see that even a lizard living in the room or even a snake living in that house should not starve. They should be also given food. And what to speak of others? The <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> before taking his lunch, he is recommended to stand on the road and declare that "If anybody is still hungry, please come. Food is ready." Then, if there is no response, then the proprietor of the household life, he takes his lunch. In this way there are so many good concept about this socialistic idea of communism. So I thought that these ideas might have been distributed to some of your thoughtful men. Therefore I was anxious to speak with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, you know, what is interesting... As it is here in our country, with our great interest in the history of old, old god, from this point of view our institute translated into Russian and published many, I may say, literary monuments of great Indian culture. I will have a pleasure to present you a copy of a booklet which was written here by me and my colleagues. It's account of Soviet studies of India. And here there is chapter, chapter second, "Studies of Ancient Indian Texts in the U.S.S.R..." You'll be interested to discover, we published not all but some, some in exceptions, <span class="Italic">Purāṇas.</span> We published most of them, then some parts of <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> eight volumes in Russian, <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata...</span> We have also second edition of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> translated by different people. <span class="Italic">Kabukare Artha-śāstra</span>(?) also was translated in full and published. <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti</span> also translated in full and published with Sanskrit commentaries. And such a great interest... I think that all these publications was sold in a week. Now quite completely out of stock, this... It was impossible to get them in book market after month, such a great interest among reading people here in Moscow and the U.S.S.R. towards ancient Indian culture. And from this point of view we published, I must say, a lot of things, a lot of things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, amongst these <span class="Italic">Purāṇas,</span> the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is called the <span class="Italic">Mahā-purāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahā-purāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So we have translated in English the full, with the original Sanskrit text, its transliteration, an English equivalent for each word, then translation, and then purport, explanation of the verse. In this way there are 18,000's of verses in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> the great saintly sages who are the preachers of this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> throughout India, their opinion is that it is the ripened fruit of the Vedic desire tree. <span class="Italic">Nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalaṁ idam [SB 1.1.3].</span> And it is accepted by all, I mean, Indian scholars, and especially Lord Caitanya, He preached this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> So we have got that, complete in English translation. If you want to see some of them, we can show you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> It seems to me that in the Moscow and Leningrad libraries we have nearly all major texts of ancient Indian culture, beginning from <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> original text in Sanskrit. For instance, we have in Lenin Library nearly six or eight editions of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Aside:) You have not brought any books? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> <span class="Italic">...Manu-smṛti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not brought any books? <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Editions is there. Especially in Leningrad, you know, in Leningrad we have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...about, Leningrad branch, Leningrad branch of our institute-because institute was in Petorussia(?), founded in Leningrad-so in Leningrad now we have now a branch of our institute dealing mainly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...with the history of Asiatic culture. We have a million...(Aside:) Thank you very much. Here is a sample account of our book. You will find here some account of what has been translated and what else is being done in the history of Indian philosophy, and now with this Indian philosophy, history of Indian religion, and now with this Indian..., what is Hinduism now, just now in India also. It is very simple account of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hinduism is a very complex term. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Oh, yes, Hinduism. It is not all... It is really... To my understanding it is not religion from European point of view. It is a really a way of life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...religion, Indian, a way of philosophy, a way of life, a religion, everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this Hinduism, Hindu, this word, is not a Sanskrit word. It is given by the Mohammedans. You know there is a river, Indus, which is..., Sanskrit name is Sindhu. Sindhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These Mohammedans, they pronounce "S" as "H." "Hindus," "Hindus." Instead of  "Sindus," they made it "Hindus." So Hindu is a term which is not found in the Sanskrit dictionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it has come into use. Real, I mean to say, cultural institution is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> four <span class="Italic">varṇas</span> and four <span class="Italic">āśramas: brāhmaṇa, kṣatri, vaiśya, śūdra</span>-these four <span class="Italic">varṇas</span>-and <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> So according to Vedic concept of life, unless people take to this system or institution, institute of <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> four <span class="Italic">varṇas</span> and four <span class="Italic">āśramas,</span> actually he does not become a civilized human being. This... One has to take this process, four divisions of <span class="Italic">varṇas</span> and four..., four divisions of social order and four divisions of spiritual order. That is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> So India's culture is based on these four, eight system, <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> <span class="Italic">Varnāśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Varṇa,</span> <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>-perhaps you have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>-there is also the statement, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is... This system is created originally by Viṣṇu. So as everything is creation of the Supreme, they cannot be changed. That is a prevalent everywhere, that a... Sun. Sun is creation of the Supreme. So sunshine is here in America, in Russia, in India-everywhere. Similarly, this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system is prevalent everywhere in some form or other. Just like the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> means the most intelligent class of men, brain, brain of the society. Then the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> the administrator class. Then the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> the productive class, and the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> the worker class. These four classes of men are everywhere present in different names. And because it is creation by the original creator, so it is prevalent everywhere, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> [break] So have you seen this little, how we are translating this? You can see little. Original <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> its transliteration, then its English equivalent, then translation, then purport, each and every verse is being done like that, whole <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam Purāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But you know what is interesting to... It is the opinion of some European and old, old Russian scholars, this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span>...is a bit late creation. If you would trace the old <span class="Italic">sūtras,</span> texts, of Vedic literature, you would find much more simple and egalitarian society. And there is an opinion that this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system was introduced into Indian society on the late stage of Vedic era but not from the beginning, about... If you would analyze scientifically the old texts, you'll find that... [break]...human estimations. (laughs) As many brains, as many estimations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...about the duration of this period because unfortunately the old classic India we have not so much information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But so far... So far we are concerned, this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span> It is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now, this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was spoken five thousand years ago, and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that "This system of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was first spoken by Me to the sun-god." So if you take estimation of that period, it comes forty millions of years. So whether the European scholars can trace out the history of at least for five thousand years together, not to speak of forty millions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have got evidences that his <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system is current at least for the five thousand years, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system. And this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa</span> also. <span class="Italic">Varnāśramācaravata puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān<br class="calibre2"/></span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 8.58]<span class="Italic">. Varnāśrama acaravata.</span> So that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa.</span> And so <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> is not a, within any historical period calculated in the modern age. It is natural. And in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> the comparison is given, just like in your body, in my body, there are four divisions, the face, facial, or the brain division, and the arms division, the belly division, and the leg division, similarly, by nature's way these four divisions are existing in the social body. You may take history wherever you begin, but this is existing. A class of men, they are considered to be brain. A class of men, they are considered to be the arms, administrators. And a class of men, they are called productive class. So there is no need of tracing the history. It is naturally existing from the day of creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> According to so many... You have just told that in any society there are four divisions, but the case is not so easy to distinguish. For instance, one can group, one can group, group together, different social classes and professional groups into four divisions in any society. There's no difficulty. Only difficulty, for instance, in socialist society of our country and a socialist society how can you distinguish productive group and workers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you belong to the intelligent class of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Intelligent, yes, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is a division.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, intelligent class, for instance, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> if you can put together also with intelligentsia under the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Then administrative staff...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣatriya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> From top to... From top to collective farm, for instance, is <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> But who would be here <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> and who <span class="Italic">śūdra?</span> That is the difficulty because all others will workers, workers, anywhere, factory workers, collective farm workers and so on. So from this point of view...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From this point of view...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...there is a great distinction, in my opinion, between socialist society and all societies preceding socialist because in a modern western society you can group all social professions, classes, for instance, practically, very conditionally, you know, at least you can, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, kṣatriyas...</span> Excuse me... Then this <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> this productive class, is owners...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...of the means of production...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...these factory owners, for instance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> And the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are workers, menial workers. But here you have no <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> from this point of view because you have administrative staff... In fact, there is administrative staff. You can call them <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> And then <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> that's workers themselves. But not this intermediate class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated, <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ:</span> "In this age practically all men will be <span class="Italic">śūdras."</span> That is... That is predicted. But if there are simply <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> then the social order will be destroyed. You... Just like in spite of your state of <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is found here. And that is necessity. So if you do not divide the social order in such a way, then there will be chaos. that is the scientific estimation of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> You may... You may belong for the time being to the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> class, but to maintain the social order you have to train some of the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> some of the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> to become <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> You cannot depend on the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Then there will be chaos. Neither you can depend only on <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Just like to fulfill the necessities of your body there must be a portion called the brain, there must be a portion called the arms, there must be a portion called the stomach, or the belly, and there must be a portion which is called the leg. The leg is also required, the brain is also required, the arm is also required-for cooperation, to fulfill the mission of the whole body. So any, any society you conceive, unless there are these four divisions, there will be chaos. It will be, not be properly, I mean to say, going on, smoothly going on. There will be some disturbance. Brain must be there. So at the present moment there is scarcity of brain. I am not talking of your state or my state. I am taking the world as it is. The brain... Formerly the Indian administration was going on in monarchy. Just like this picture. This picture is a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> king. Before his death he renounced his, I mean to say, royal order and he came to the forest to hear about self-realization. So if you want to maintain the peace and prosperity of the whole worldly social order, you must create a class of men very intelligent, a class of men very expert in administration, a class of men very expert in production, and a class of men to work. That is required. You cannot avoid it. That is the Vedic conception. <span class="Italic">Mukha-bāhūru-padebhyaḥ.</span> They say, <span class="Italic">mukha... Mukha</span> means the face. <span class="Italic">Bahu</span> means the arm. <span class="Italic">Uru</span> means this, this, or waist. And <span class="Italic">pada.</span> So anywhere, either you take this state or that state-doesn't matter-unless there is a smooth, systematic establishment of these four orders of life, the state or the society will not go very smoothly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Generally it seems to me that this old <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system to some extent practiced the nature of division of labor in ancient society. So now division of labor among people in any society is much more complicated and sophisticated. So it would be very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...conditionally(?) to group them in four classes because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The, the confusion, confusion has come into existence because in India in later days the son of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> without having the brahminical qualification, claimed to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> and others, out of superstition or traditional way, they were accepted as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Therefore the Indian social order has disrupted. But our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are picking up from everywhere <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> everywhere, because the world needs the brain of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Just like here, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, although he was a monarch, he had a body of learned sages and <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> to consult, advisory body. It is not that the monarchs were independent. In the history it is found that some of the monarchs were not in order. They were dethroned by the brahminical advisory committee. Although the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they did not take part in politics, but they would give advice to the monarch how to, I mean to say, execute the royal function. Just like not, not very old, very, say, about... What is the age of, I mean to say, Asoka? Say about thousands of years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> As we call from our... In our terminology we call, in ancient and medieval India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Med... Yes. In medieval India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...and old and feudal India, you are right, this was very often. And from <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> from <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> the major part of height is(?) religious stuff (?) (rigid stock) in religious department(?). Even Mogul emperors, there were <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> who advised modern Mogul emperors...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...in administration...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...and such like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our predecessor <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī, he was finance minister in the Mohammedan government. He was. When he resigned, the Nawab was not very satisfied, that "I cannot relieve you because you are my right hand man. If you resign all of a sudden in this way, then I shall arrest you." There is a long history. So that's a fact. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> were kept. So the advisory committee of the king... Now, as I was going to speak, Candragupta, Candragupta, just the lastest Hindu king, Candragupta... Candragupta is the age of Alexander the Great because at that time, during Candragupta's..., little before Candragupta, Alexander the Great from Greece, they went to India and conquered some portion. So this Candragupta, when he became emperor, he had his prime minister, Canakya. Perhaps you heard this name, Canak... Ca-na-kya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Canakya. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was a great politician, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And under whose name in New Delhi all the foreign embassies, they are flocked together. Yes. It is called Canakya Purī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Hm hm. Canakya Purī, yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this Canakya Paṇḍita was a great politician and <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he was vastly learned. He has got some moral instruction. They're very valuable, still going on. In India school children are taught. So this Canakya Paṇḍita, although he was prime minister, he maintained his brahminical spirit. He was not accepting any salary, yes, because for <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> to accept salary, it is understood that he becomes a dog. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.</span> He can advise, but he cannot accept. So he was living in a cottage, but he was prime minister. So this brahminical culture, the brahminical brain, is the standard of Vedic civilization. Just like <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti. Manu-smṛti...</span> You do not know. You cannot trace out the history, when <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti</span> was written. But <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti</span> is considered so perfect that it is the Hindu law. The Hindus are governed by <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti.</span> There was no need of passing daily a new law by the legislative assembly to adjust this social order. You see? The law given by Manu was so perfect that it can be applicable for all the time. This is perfect. <span class="Italic">Tri-kāla-jñāḥ.</span> The word is there, <span class="Italic">tri-kāla-jñāḥ,</span> past, present, future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But... I am sorry to interrupt you, but originally, to my knowledge, original Indian society, when, in the second half of Indian society, when in Calcutta by order of British administration was codified, so-called, you know, remember, "Jantu Law," they called, a big digest of Hindu law, there was a lot of change...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...called in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they manufactured another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> And this, the actual Hindu law which was used by Hindus, they're quite different from original <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they have now made changes. Just like our late Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. He made some Hindu code. He introduced in that Hindu code the right of divorcing husband and wife. But these were not in <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā.</span> And, of course, they are changing. If you like, you can change. But the social order also not exactly the same as it was before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And so many things. So they're changing. But before this modern age the whole Hindu society was being governed by <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti. Manu-smṛti,</span> yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> In all periods in India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti.</span> Now they are changing so many. They... Strictly speaking, the modern Hindus, they are not strictly according to the Hindu scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They are not... So our point is, we are not going to bring back the old type of Hindu society. It is not that. Our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> It is impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is impossible. Our idea is that best ideas from the original idea. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> there is a description of communistic idea, and it is being described to Mahārāja Yudhisthira. So if there is something good, good experience, why it should not be adopted? That is our point of view. And besides that, in the modern civilization they are missing one point: the aim of human life, scientifically. The aim of human life is self-realization, <span class="Italic">ātmā-tattvam.</span> It is said, <span class="Italic">parābhavas tāvad abodha-jātaḥ yāvan na jijñāsa ātmā-tattvam.</span> Unless the human society comes to the point of self-realization, whatever they are doing, they are being defeated, <span class="Italic">parābhava.</span> I think you know this word, <span class="Italic">parābhava. Parābhava. Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jātaḥ.</span> So actually it is happening so. The modern society, human society, there is advancement, economic advancement, so many things, advancement. Still, in the matter of keeping peace and tranquility there is fight, individually, socially, politically, nationally. So if we think very cool-headed, then in spite of so much improvement in so many branches of knowledge, we are keeping the same mentality of quarreling. That is also visible in lower animal society. So our conclusion, according to <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> that this body, human body, it is not meant for working very hard for sense gratification. In the modern civilization the ultimate goal, aim, is sense gratification. That's all. Beyond that, they do not know anything more. They do not know what is next life. There is no department of knowledge or science, scientific department, to study what is there after life, after finishing this body. That is a great, I mean to say, department of knowledge. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]. Dehe. Deha</span> means this body. So there is a <span class="Italic">dehinaḥ</span> who owns the body, <span class="Italic">dehi.</span> So <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.</span> The <span class="Italic">dehi,</span> the owner of the body, is within, and the body's changing from one form to another. The body of a child, baby, a certain type of form, it changes into another type of form when he's child, another type when boy, another type when he's young, another type, he's old. This is going on, but the owner of the body existing. Similarly, when this body will be completely changed, another body he will accept. So people do not understand this. As we are accepting different body even in this present life from babyhood to childhood, from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youthhood... That's a fact. Everyone knows it. I was a child, but that childhood body is no more. I have got a different body. Similarly, what is the difficulty to understand: when this body will be no more, I'll have to accept another body? It is great science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> As you know, there is two ultimate, two quite, I may say, opposite approaches to this problem. One approach is slightly different by different religions but in the same time, any religion recognizes in such or such form the change...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Change of place of a spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transmigration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Called transmigration of spirit, etc. As in Christian religion and in Buddhism and Hindu religion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'm not talking of religion, belief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm talking of science and philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> If we can... So science and philosophy. But another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One religion may accept. One may... That is not our purpose. We are talking on the point of that if the owner of the body is permanent in spite of different change of the body, then what is the difficulty to understand that when this body will be changed, the owner of the body will have another body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But another approach is that there is no separate own..., there is no separate..., no two phenomena, owner of the body and body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> The body and owner of the body is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> When body dies, the owner also dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> There is no separate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... Why? Why there is no department of knowledge in university to study this fact scientifically? That is my proposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means they are lacking. It may be as you say, or it may be as I say, but there must be a department of knowledge, what is the... Now, recently one cardiologist, a doctor, he has accepted that there is soul, in Montreal and Toronto. I had some correspondence with him. So he is strongly in belief that there is soul. So that is another point of view, but we accept knowledge from authority. Authority. Just like this statement is given by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the authority by all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is studied amongst the scholarly circle and philosophical circle still, all over the world. And this statement is given by Kṛṣṇa:</div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So <span class="Italic">dehāntaram prāpti...</span> Just like the childhood, now, giving up the childhood body, the soul is coming to the boyhood body, from boyhood, youth..., similarly, the soul, giving up this body, he accepts another body. This statement is given by Kṛṣṇa, the greatest authority according to our tradition of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So suppose we accept such statement without any argument. That is the way of Vedic understanding. Vedic understanding means you have to accept whatever is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> without any argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> So forget about <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Our approach is we don't believe in anything without argument. We can believe only on anything based on argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Here is the basic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...projecting (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is allowed. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">, paripraśnena sevayā.Paripraṣna,</span> argument, is allowed, but not with a challenging spirit. With a spirit to rightly understand. <span class="Italic">Praṇipātena paripraśnena.</span> That... Argument is not denied. But so far Vedic statements are there, they are infallible, infallible, and the followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they accept in that way. For example, just like cow dung.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the stool of an animal. Now, the Vedic statement there is: "As soon as you touch the stool of any animal, you are impure. You have to purify yourself by taking bath." Even in your own stool... According to Hindu system, if you go to evacuate, after coming you have to take bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> This is quite intact with modern medicine knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...that you must clean yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, that's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But another place it is stated that "Cow dung, although it is the stool of an animal, it is pure." Even if you apply in an impure place, you become purified. Now, this is superficially contradicting. In one place it is said that "The stool of an animal is impure. As soon as you touch, you have to be purified," and another place it is said that "Cow dung is pure." So according to our knowledge, it is contradictory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But those who are followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they are accepting. Is it not, cow dung, pure? Cow dung pure, it is not accepted by the followers of <span class="Italic">Vedas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you analyze chemically, you'll find the cow dung contains all antiseptic properties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> This I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know, but there is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> I have to test. This I do not know, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, one must try to realize it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that... That... One Dr. Ghosh, professor of medical college, Lal Mohan Ghosh, he... I was medically connected in my previous life. So that Lal Mohan Ghosh analyzed it, and, it is his statement, it is full of, I mean to say, antiseptic properties. So Vedic statements, even sometimes you find it is contradictory, but if you analyze scrutinizingly, you find it is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But maybe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There may be some exceptions, but, I mean to say, just like the cow dung is stool-this is an exception-but why this exception is accepted, that if you scientifically examine, analyze, you find it is correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> That is due to analyze. That's right. That's from common sense point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, another, another instance is there. Just like conchshell. Conchshell is the bone of an animal. So according to Vedic instruction, if you touch the bone of an animal, you become impure. You have to take bath. You become impure. But this conchshell is kept in the deity room because it's accepted as pure by the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> So my point is that we accept Vedic laws in such a way, without argument, accept because it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and that is the principle followed by scholars. If you can substantiate your statement by quoting from the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> then it is accepted. You do not require to substantiate in other ways if you prove by Vedic quotation. <span class="Italic">Śruti-pramāṇa.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">śruti-pramāṇa.</span> There are different kinds of <span class="Italic">pramāṇa,</span> evidences. Just like in the legal court if you can give quotation from the law books, your statement is accepted, similarly, all statements which you give, if they are supported by <span class="Italic">śruti-pramāṇa...</span> I think you know. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are known as <span class="Italic">Śrutis.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Hm hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śruti-smṛti-purāṇadi-pāñcarātriki-vidhiṁ vina</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs.</i> 1.2.101]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anysystem we accept, it must be supported by the evidences of <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti-purāṇadi-pāñcarātriki. Aikāntikī harer bhaktir utpātāyai...</span> Anything which is not supported by <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti...</span> Just like <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti.</span> This is <span class="Italic">Smṛti.</span> And <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are <span class="Italic">Śruti. Śruti-smṛti-purāṇadi pāñcarātriki-vi...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs.</i> 1.2.101]<span class="Italic">, aikāntikī harer bhaktir utpātāyaiva kalpate.</span> Which is not evidence, which is not true by these <span class="Italic">pramāṇas,</span> then it is disturbance. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But I mean to say one thing is, like in <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> whatever is written could have been proved like in a scientific way, today... Suppose there is a lab which is scientific. Whatever is said by that lab, that "This is truth," accepted without going to argue into the propriety of it... Suppose you have a scientific knowledge shop or a place, and if this workshop or this scientific institution states, "This is not good. This is not good," a general body accepts, take it for granted, "Yes, scientific body has said so. It is understood. It's..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Hm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Personally he hasn't got to examine, himself. He takes the statement of an authority and believes him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Common person, a common man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Vedic authorities, authoritative statement, are accepted by the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Just like India is governed by the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, and Śaṅkarācārya. They accept in that, and the followers accept them. The benefit is that whether cow dung is pure or impure, I do not waste my time, but because it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> I take it, so I save my time. <span class="Italic">Śruti-pramāṇa.</span> In that way there are different statements in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> for sociology and politics and anything because <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> means knowledge. <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> means knowledge. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">. Vetti veda vido jñāne. Vid-dhātu,</span> when it is used for knowledge, it is called <span class="Italic">Veda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But today, I think, the scientific knowledge people will not accept all this, what you are saying only. They would perhaps like to try it once more, and perhaps, after going through the process of examination of theirs, they accept it if it is true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, well correct. As I have already said our approach, the approach of people today, new era of knowledge everywhere in the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Try once more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Try once more. You are right. And also nobody would believe in anything without argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, arguments are allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, arguments. Nobody would believe because it was written in this or other script. Evidence, evidence and evidence has to be given to believe. And may I put one question to you? Have you many branches of your society everywhere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Where is your main center, and where are the branches?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Main center...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Of Kṛṣṇa consciousness society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of course, I have got about fifty-five branches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Fifty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So I have made my main center in Los Angeles.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Because I brought a letter from western Germany, so I had an idea that is probably...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is a... There is a branch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> A branch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Germany branch, Kṛṣṇa dāsa. There is a branch. But my headquarter is in Los Angeles. And now, since I came to India, I am trying to make my headquarter in Māyāpur. That's the place, the birthsite, of Lord Caitanya. We have purchased land there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> In Māyāpur?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Māyāpur. You have heard the name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, yes. Māyāpur is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have been in India?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> I very there, to like it (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have been in Māyāpur, Lord Caitanya's birthsite?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> No, Māyāpur... It's also called Māyāpuram.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Māyāpuram, it is... That is in Madras side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mylapuram.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> There's a Mylapuram, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mylapuram. That is Madras city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So where generally you stayed in India?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Oh, I was run away in many places, about, in Delhi, in Delhi, in Rajastan, in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bengal, Bihar...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bengal where you stayed ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> In Bengal?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Bengal. And by origin you are from...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Calcutta. Ah, Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. My birth place is in Calcutta, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> I understand. Yes, unfortunately I haven't been to North Bengal. You have just visited Pakistan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Calcutta, Bombay and several places, Gorakhpur. Gorakhpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Oh. It's a very difficult situation in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...Bengal and Calcutta...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...because of influx of refugees from Bangladesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But we had our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> festival for ten days, and people participated very wonderfully. We... Our gathering was not less than thirty thousand people daily, and they are so much interested in hearing about our... Lecture things, we are lecturing from <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We are... Our preaching method is on the basis of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> So people are responding from every part of the world, especially the American boys. They are especially interested. And England also, and Germany, and France. From here I shall go to Paris. There we have got center. What is the name of that place? Paris? Recently they have taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Recently they have changed the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh. In some suburb, Fontenay Rose, Fontenay aux Rose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Ah, near Paris?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> In Fontaine Bleau?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. They have taken a whole house, nice house. So our process is very simple. We ask our students to refrain from four prohibitive principles: no illi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> From? I'm sorry. From? Four?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prohibitive. No illicit sex life, no meat-eating, meat or fish or eggs, no, and no gambling, and no intoxication, including cigarette, tea, coffee. These also we take as intoxicants. So these four principle one has to obey, and let him chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> And by this process only, you'll find, how these boys and girls are improving quickly. Process is very simple. Besides that, we have got books, volumes of books, just like <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I have given them. Throughout all these years I have written so many books. And they have got ample stock for reading, the whole life. We have got four hundred pages', big, big books, about one dozen books: Kṛṣṇa in two parts, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> in six parts, <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya,</span> one part, <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion,</span> one part. In this way I am... And these are... We are publishing every month one chapter, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> with this detailed information, giving a heading like this, "The First Step in God Realization." Here is also. The heading is: <span class="Italic">"Puruṣa-śukta</span> Continued." <span class="Italic">Puruṣa-śukta</span> is a Vedic <span class="Italic">stotram.</span> So we are trying to push this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like in your country there is Lenin consciousness, similarly, it is also a different type of consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa is also historical personality as much as Lenin is also historical personality. So His philosophy... Just like you are trying to understand his philosophy, we are trying to understand Kṛṣṇa's philosophy. In this way this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> And have you many participants...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...in these fifty-five branches?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, more than three thousand, three thousand initiated. And outside admirers, there are many, many. And this means these three thousand who have accepted the principles, just like these boys. So there are fifty-five branches. In each branch we are maintaining twenty-five to hundred students. So just imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But does that mean the students, they abstain for normal West European universities their own, all their... How to explain it? Their... For instance, can a normal student from, for instance, from one of the best universities, who is attending lectures in normal way, etc., also be initiated and admitted to your community?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, both ways. Both ways. If you want to be initiated, you are welcome. If not, you come. Try to understand our philosophy. Read our books. There are so many books, magazines. And question, answer. Try to understand the philosophy. It is not that all of a sudden a student comes and becomes our disciple, no. They first of all come, associate, try to understand. Then... We do not canvass. When he voluntarily says that "I want to be your..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> No, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no canvassing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> No, yes. That's what I thought. But what I am most interested in... For instance, not a student but a young worker or a young son of a farmer, he would abstain from his old life and he would be initiated and join your community into a given center. How he would entertain himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is... I have alre...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> In the sorts of day to day life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Material life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, material life, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Would he be paid to stay in that center?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am answering. As I told you that this propaganda is meant for creating some <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> all over the world because the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> element is lacking, so one who seriously comes to us, he has to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So he has to adopt the occupation of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> and he has to give up the occupation of a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> or a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But if one wants to keep his profession, at the same time wants to understand also, that is allowed. Just like we have many professors. There is Howard Wheeler, professor of Ohio University. He's my disciple. So he is continuing his professorship. But whatever money he's getting, almost he's spending for our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> those who are householders living outside, they are expected to contribute fifty per cent of the income for the society, twenty-five per cent for the family, and twenty-five per cent for his personal emergency. After all, in this world, if we live... So far we are concerned, we are <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> but you are a professor. If there is some emergency, you cannot go to beg. But I am a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> I can tell you that I am in difficulty. That is the system. So we have got four orders. Just like he's <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> and he's <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> He has got his wife, children. So he's a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> He's a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> Similarly, there is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> So that is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. It doesn't matter whether one is a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> householder, or renounced order or a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> or a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> It doesn't matter. If anyone understands the science of Kṛṣṇa, he becomes the spiritual master. The exact word is, in Bengali, <span class="Italic">kiba vipra kiba śūdra nyāsi kene nāya...</span> Do you understand little Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> No, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As a vibration...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yei kṛṣṇa tattva vettha sei guru hāya.</span> Anyone who understands the science of Kṛṣṇa, he can become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> I understand. But in generally, by creating <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> from different social classes of society, really you deny the old prescription of Hindu script...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I establish old, old scrip... I establish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Because according to old script, the <span class="Italic">Purāṇas,</span> etc., every member of one of the four classes, these <span class="Italic">varṇas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...is to be born inside it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...but not appointed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, no. No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> This is the major...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that... I am sorry...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...foundation of all the <span class="Italic">varṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not speaking correctly. I beg... We beg... With great respect I beg to submit, you are, that you are not speaking correctly. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ māyā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ: [Bg. </span>4.13] "These four orders of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra</span> is created by Me according to quality and work." There is no mention of birth. There is no mention of birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, I agree with you that this was addition of late <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> who tried to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that, that has killed the Indian culture. You see? Otherwise there was no necessity of division of this Pakistan. Not only that, from history, perhaps you know, this whole planet was Bhāratavarṣa, and it was controlled by one flag up to Mahārāja Parīkṣit. Gradually they separated, separated. This is the history. And late, lately they have separated Pakistan. So Bhāratavarṣa is now crippled into a small piece of land. Otherwise this whole... According to our scripture, Vedic scripture, this, this whole planet is called Bhāratavarṣa. Formerly it was named Ilāvṛtavarṣa, but since the Emperor Bhārata ruled over this planet, it is called Bhāratavarṣa from Mahārāja Bhārata. So this culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Vedic culture, were existing... Now any religion you take, Christian religion, Mohammedan religion or Buddhist religion, they are, utmost, two thousand, three thousand old, years old. But this Vedic scripture, you cannot trace out where is the beginning, where is the beginning. It is therefore called <span class="Italic">sanātana,</span> eternal. And this culture is for the whole human society. It is not a departmental religious faith. Religious faith you can change, but real <span class="Italic">dharma</span> you cannot change. Just like... You try to understand. Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> He says:</div>
<div class="Verse">yadā yadā hi dharmasya<br class="calibre2"/>glanīr bhavati bhārata<br class="calibre2"/>abhyutthānam adharmasya<br class="calibre2"/>tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.7]</div>
<div class="Verse">paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>vināśāya ca duṣkṛtaṁ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Duṣkṛtānam, dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya yuge yuge sambhavāmi. Now, Kṛṣṇa came to establish the religious principles, and in the last stage of speaking He says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya māmekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> And that is real <span class="Italic">dharma, mām ek...,</span> to surrender to the Supreme. That is real <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> We are surrendering. Anyone, just like you or me, anyone, we are surrendering to somebody. That's a fact. Our, our life is by surrender. Is it not? Do you disagree with this point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> To some extent you surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, to, to the full extent. Just like you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> You are required to surrender to the society, for instance, to the whole people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, just... Whole people or the state or the king or the government, whatever you say-this surrender must be there. It may be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> I'm sorry. Only there's a difficulty. We can't agree that you have surrender to government or surrender to a king. There's a principle difference of surrender to a king, to a person, or surrender to a society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is... That is a change of color only. But the surrender is there. The principle of surrender is there. Either you surrender to monarchy, either you surrender to democracy or aristocracy or, what is called, dictatorship, you have to surrender. That's a fact. That's a fact. Without surrendering, our life is... There is no life. That is not possible. So we are educating persons to surrender to the Supreme wherefrom you get all protection. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mam ekam śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">, aham tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> So surrender is there. Nobody can say, "Now I am not surrendering to anyone." There is not a single person. Difference is where he is surrendering, where he is surrendering. The ultimate surrendering objective is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate: [Bg. </span>7.19] "After surrendering to so many things, birth after birth, when he's actually wise he surrenders unto Me." <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ: [Bg. </span>7.19] "Such kind of <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is very rare."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes. But at the same time, it seems to me that surrender, surrender is to be accompanied with revolt. The history of mankind has proved but by only revolt against some kind of surrender...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...mankind has been developed from medieval age... Like French Revolution, it was revolt against surrender. But this revolt also was surrender itself to the rank and file of the people, their (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But so it is not enough to put a full stop on surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Surrender is to be accompanied with revolt against surrender of other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore the surrender will be full stop when the surrender is to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Ah ha ha, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is full stop, no more surrendering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Final surrendering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other surrender you have to change by revolution, but when you come to Kṛṣṇa, then it is sufficient. You are satisfied. Just like... I'll give you one example, that a child is crying, and people changing laps, "Oh, you are crying." It is not stopping. But as soon as the small baby comes to the lap of his mother, he stops: "Yes, full satisfied."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Final satisfaction of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these changes, this surrendering, will go on in different categories. Actually all the surrenders-sum total is surrender to <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">daivī hy eṣā guṇamayi mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this surrender is going on, going on. It is the <span class="Italic">māyā's, māyāra vaibhava,</span> paraphernalia of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> either you surrender to this or to that. But final surrender-<span class="Italic">mām eva ye prapadyante, māyām etāṁ taranti te</span>-the final surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Then he is happy. Surrender will stay. His process of surrender is there, but this surrender keeps him quite satisfied, transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes. And haven't you come across some hostile attitude to your teaching from orthodox Hindu, from orthodox <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> in India itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But rather, we have subdued them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we are... Any orthodox Hindu may come, but we have got our weapons, Vedic evidences. So nobody has come. But even Christian priest... Even Christian priests in America, they love me. They say that "These boys..., our boys... They are Americans. They are Christians. They are Jews. And these boys are so much after God, and we could not deliver them?" They're admitting. Their fathers, their parents, come to me. They also flatly offer their obeisances and say, "Swamiji, it is our great fortune that you have come. You are teaching God consciousness." So on the contrary, I have got reception from other countries. And India also, as you inquired of India, all other sects, they're admitting that before me many hundreds of swamis went there, but they could not convert to Kṛṣṇa consciousness a single person. They are admiring that. And so far I am concerned, I don't take any credit, but I am confident that because I am presenting the Vedic knowledge as it is, without any adulteration, it is being effective. That is my contribution. Just like if you have got a right medicine and if you administer to a patient, you must be sure that he'll cure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> And how many disciples you have in India itself? From three thousand, how many members of your community you have in India itself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And India, there are many Kṛṣṇa conscious persons, hundred thousands, millions. India, there is no question. There is not a single Hindu who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, I understand, but this, especially, specifically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vaiṣṇava. This is called Vaiṣṇava cult. The Vaiṣṇavas, as far as you know-you have been in India-there are many millions of Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many millions of Vaiṣṇavas and... Just like this gentleman. He is a commander of the Air, India Air Lines. So he's not my disciple, but he's a Vaiṣṇava, Kṛṣṇa conscious. Similarly, in India millions and trillions there are, Kṛṣṇa conscious persons. And practically there is not a single... Even there are Mohammedan Kṛṣṇa conscious. In Allahabad University there is a Mohammedan professor. He's a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. So this is natural. It is said in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is everywhere, in everyone's heart. It has to be awakened only by this process. That's all. It is there in your heart also. It is not that it is foreign to you. It is not that. Everyone's heart, there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. By this process we have to awaken that. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇādi śuddha citte karaye udaya. Udaya.</span> You know this word <span class="Italic">udaya.</span> Just like sun rises. It is not that sun all of a sudden comes from somewhere. It is there, but it rises in the morning. Similarly, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness is everywhere, but some way or other, it is now covered. By this process it is awakened and aroused, by association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> You came yesterday to Moscow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Have you seen something here in Moscow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> No? Not much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not very much interested for sightseeing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But in any case, if you have come, you ought to go somewhere and to see something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> 'Cause to stay in a hotel, old style hotel like National, is not interesting. Not many people to see. And you are leaving day after tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my program. Day after tomorrow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> From here you are going to...?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> For Europe. Ah, for Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paris. And we have got two ceremonies, very big ceremonies, in London and San Francisco, Ratha-yatra, car festival. And, it is estimated, fifty thousand people are going to participate in the ceremony both in London and San Francisco. We are making arrangement, car festival. This car festival is observed in Jagannātha Purī. You have been in Jagannātha Purī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> From immemorial time, this festival...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Very well parked(?)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...that car, very interesting piece of car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That has been introduced in the Western countries, in London and San Francisco. And gradually, maybe, we will introduce in other countries also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> In London among Indian community...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...among the different(?) peoples of Indian community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is organized by the Englishmen and the Americans. Indian communities in London and San Francisco, they are trying to become <span class="Italic">sahib.</span> You know the word <span class="Italic">sahib?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> (laughs) Westernized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Westernized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Modern process of Westernization is going on in the world. But Prof. Srinivas...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...with the very grace (indistinct) of some anthropologists at Delhi University...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> I agree with him that a very interesting... Two processes. The process of Westernization among <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> mainly and upper castes and so-called Sanskritization he calls the process of adopting some <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> rituals, etc., by so-called low castes, even untouchables. Very interesting processes in India just now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now one thing... The other day I was speaking to some... Where I was? In Bombay, I think, I was speaking some respectable gentlemen that "Kṛṣṇa says:</div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya<br class="calibre2"/>ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās<br class="calibre2"/>te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 9.32]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Kṛṣṇa says, 'Even those who are low-born, <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni</span>-the <span class="Italic">striya, vaiśya</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> they are also included-but by accepting Me, accepting my shelter, they are also elevated to the transcendental position.' Now, why the higher class of Hindu society, they neglected this injunction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Suppose one is <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni.</span> Kṛṣṇa says that 'They can be elevated to the transcendental position if they accept Me.' Why this propaganda was not done by the higher class people so that the so-called <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni</span> could be elevated? Why you rejected them? The result was that the Mohammedans... Instead of accepting them, you rejected them, and they have partitioned, and they have gone away, and they have become eternal enemy of India." You see? So this is the first time that we are trying to elevate to the highest position of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even one is in the <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni.</span> It doesn't matter because soul is pure. <span class="Italic">Asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ.</span> The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says, "The soul is untouched by any material contamination." Simply, temporarily, he is covered. This covering should be opened. Then he becomes pure. That is the mission of human life, to uncover ourselves from this material envelopment and come to the spiritual understanding, surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Life is perfect. (break?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Thank you for taking interest in so many... Unfortunately I am leaving early tomorrow morning, quite early, to the South, and I won't be able to help you, but probably through your embassy you can meet some people from our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not interested. I came to see you especially...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Some people from Christian Orthodox Church may be interested to have some discussion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if there is some discussion, I am prepared. It is, after all, for the whole human society, and it is being practically appreciated. So if there is possibility, I am, for two days I can meet some gentlemen. I can meet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Well, if you can ask Mr. Natarajan from embassy, to perform...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not, not in that way. If some of your assistant does it, then it is all right because, to tell you frankly, so far our Indian government is concerned, they are not very much interested with this movement. Yes. Their program is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, of course, Indian government program is more and more secular in general ideology, westernized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But of course, people are not very happier. One gentleman... He's in government service. I am speaking, in 19..., sometimes, 1950. He was in statistics department, Mr. Dal(?), Kashmiri gentleman. He was coming to me in Allahabad. He told me that "I went... I go to the villages, and the villagers say, <span class="Italic">'Bābuji, angrej ko bahut </span>(indistinct)?' " That was his statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> People...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yeah, because every..., there are some kind of people in some administrative departments who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the difficulty is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...are both masters(?) and ex-British officers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ... the difficulty, that India is nowhere. They are trying to imitate, Westernize, but they are hundred years back. From materialistic point of view, technological point of view, they are hundred years back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, that's right, but what to do for India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> To improve the condition of life, to be Westernized is the major problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... But there is one thing that I am experiencing. India's the spiritual asset, if that is distributed, that will increase India's (indistinct). That is my... Because everywhere I go, still people adore India's spiritual culture. They are after India. And if they are properly distributed, the treasurehouse of Indian spiritual knowledge, then at least people outside India, they'll think that "We are getting something from India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Oh, you are right in this sense to my mind that the Indian cultural heritage is to be made known everywhere. That's right. But from the..., in the same time, in what way this would benefit Indian training masters(?) themselves? Because they are sitting in India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...and they have nothing from spreading of Indian cultural heritage and etc. over the world. Indian villagers have to have fertilizers, tractors, etc...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not object to that. There is no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, I don't think that you object.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But at the same time, something has to be done in India itself. In what line, if you... One may call it Westernization from this introduction of technical revolution in all spheres of Indian life, in agriculture, industry, etc...</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, this picture... This is Viṣvarūpa. It was shown to Arjuna. Now, Arjuna, before understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> was a fighter, warrior. And after understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he remained a fighter. So we don't want to change the position. Just like you are a respectable professor, teacher. We don't say that you change your position. We have come to convince you about our philosophy. That's all. So just like the same example: Arjuna, he was denying to fight, "Kṛṣṇa, I do not like to kill my relatives. I don't want this kingdom." But he was taught <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And at the end, when Kṛṣṇa inquired, "What is your decision now?" he said, <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">:</span> "Yes, I shall act accordingly, as You say." That means his consciousness was changed. He remained a fighter. He was a fighter, he remained a fighter, but he changed his consciousness. We want that. We don't want to disturb the present condition of the society. No. But we try to make them understand that "There is a great necessity of you to understand this consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness." That is our goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But at the same time, the final goal of any consciousness is to change society...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...to make a better society. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is automatically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> I am not very so happy to hear that your ultimate goal is not to disturb society as such because in modern society there are many things to be changed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> ...through some consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That preliminary changes... Just like we prohibit, "Don't take intoxicants."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> To change... Not to change culture. Intoxication is not primarily (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if he becomes, if he takes to these processes, then automatically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Transformation(indistinct) will take place automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...his whole life is changed. Yes. Because these four things-illicit sex life, intoxication, meat-eating, and gambling-they are very great impediments for social improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And that will automatically make his life simpler because a person who is not indulging in illicit sex life or intoxication and other things has to live a comparatively simpler life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> That's right. One will live much simpler life, agreed. But at the same time, would it change some complex things...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, no, it won't change the complex for simple reason that a person who's not indulging in this one and he's conscious, he'll be also concious to work hard competitively when he is quite sure that he cannot rob somebody if he wants his food, and he can't rob it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> But if you would, will have many, even many followers, how far this adaption of Kṛṣṇa consciousness by many American boys would affect the politics of their attitude, for instance, to such a bearing problem of America as Vietnam War?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Correct. They'll never be the one who will ever advocate any war because they know this war itself is a wrong thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We don't say, "Avoid war." But unnecessary war is avoided. Just like Kṛṣṇa induced Arjuna to fight. It was necessary. It was necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> To get rid of extra evil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was necessary. So nothing is avoided, but everything is utilized for proper purpose. Nothing is rejected. <span class="Italic">Nirbandhe kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.</span> This is fact, that Kṛṣṇa never advocated that "Let there be stop of war." No. When there is necessity, absolute necessity, there may be war but for their good purpose, not by the whims of the politicians, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Hm hm. That's right. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you can arrange some program, it is all right. There are... It is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Is there any possibility Swamiji could lecture at the institute itself in the next day or two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> I don't think because, you know, now it is vacation time. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...Vedic Concept of Communism," "Knowledge by Authorized Tradition," and what was the other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> "Scientific Values of..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Scientific Classless Society." This subject matter I wanted...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Have you put into writing these three subjects somewhere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I asked... Because I could not contact him, therefore I asked the ambassador. But unfortunately they said that "We did not receive any letter like that." So you can note down if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, it is interesting to read also your text of your lectures. But it is not here? It is...? Kṛṣṇa consciousness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets.</span> No? No, what is this? <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the Topmost Yoga System.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> See, the Swamiji is only going to be here two more days, so if there's any possibility, people can take advantage to have him speak in public or in groups. Do you think it's possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> It's... It's... I can't help because I am leaving tomorrow very early for the South, and I shall be here only on the 1st of July. Yes. So from this point it will be difficult, yes. Probably... My advice would be through an ambassador you can come in contact with this, our religious organization. That would be very interesting to have some lecture in group, lecture in group, and some discussion of all this. That would be... That would be very possible, a little. So he can come back if... I would say tomorrow, but I can't manage it myself, but..., as I am leaving at six, leaving, plane is leaving at 8:15 tomorrow morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You mean to say that some ambassador's men should see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Yes, it seems to me that your ambassador's men can come in contact with special, our religious organizations and can organize for you both meetings and conferences. There's no difficulty for some men. That would be interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can say. We shall arrange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Kotovsky:</span> Hm hm. That you can. That you can... (end)</div>
