<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The big two wars of the world happened only on account of this industry. Do you know that? The cause is the big, big industry. Germany industrial, they produce goods. They must have market. But when they go to sell, there is no market. Britishers will not allow to sell them. The Britisher will take, purchase from them, and stamp it "Made in England" and sell it. And this is the cause of two big war. Therefore German declare twice war. Disaster.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think you missed that verse, <span class="Italic">jagato ahitāya.</span> Anyway, these are the description of demonic activities. So this is practical. The last two disastrous war was waged only for this industry. This is the cause. German, they are actually in Europe very intelligent and their machine products and other things, they make very nice things. At least, I have got experience, German chemicals are first-class chemical. So they manufacture and British occupied the half of the world in their colonization, whole Africa, and they controlled India and China, Japan, yes, China, Burma, Ceylon, Australia. So these poor people, they manufactured. They have got goods enough; where to sell? As soon as they go to the British territories, "No, you cannot sell. If you want to sell, then hundred percent duty." So price increase. This was the grudge. Everyone knows. This is the cause of two wars. The <span class="Italic">jagato ahita.</span> Now, why so much? You require a scissor? Go to a blacksmith and pay something. He'll make a scissor. "No. Produce millions of scissor." Then where is market, sir? This is going on. Produce millions of TV machine. Simple they are used for wasting time. One or two or five made for some important business. Now they are producing millions of sets. They must sell. And people are induced to purchase. And as soon as they purchase, they simply see television. Idol worship. And learning vicious things. Some unnecessary picture is produced there. They like to see it. Two train are coming and they are smashed. (laughs) I have seen some television. People are learning how to smash, how to steal, how to harass people. Things are being shown like that. Not that "You are soul. You are spirit soul. If you degrade yourself, you then get this." You make that television, that how transmigration of the soul is taking place. They have manufactured the machine, so utilize for your propaganda. We have got to do so many things. We can utilize everything. So if they are not used for Kṛṣṇa's purpose they'll be used for committing disaster in the world. Just like the atomic bomb. They are meant for creating disaster, that's all. What else they can do? And now everyone is having atomic weapon, just like India has now got. That means they are preparing, by nature's course they are preparing for war, and "I put my atomic bomb on your head, and you put on my head. You die, I die, that's all." They simply die. Now what was the result of the disastrous war twice? The whole European nations ruined. They are not no more rich. I saw in Paris, in Germany. They are not as rich as the Americans. Because American inland, there was no such big war, so their opulence is existing, but on account of these two wars, British completely finished. Yes. British completely. It is now... Hitler wanted that "I shall again make these English people a fisherman's island. They have to take their business to fishing only." (laughter) That was Hitler's declaration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That has happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That has happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They are fishing all over the world, trying to get some oil, trying to get some steel, how to get some grain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cāru:</span> They only work two days in a week now in England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That's finished now. During the petrol shortage they had to cut themselves down to two days a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they have got Australia. Australia is English possession?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cāru:</span> Not any more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I know, all educated and advanced educated Englishmen, they were coming to Australia for good job. Therefore most of the technical posts, they are occupied by Indians in London. As soon as one is highly qualified medical man, he comes to Australia. So who will take care of them? So therefore they imported some brain from India. Anyway, our time should be saved for self-realization. That is perfect civilization. And not for creating unnecessary necessity of life. That will increase problem. So scientists, they disagreed or agreed with us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They did not want to get... They did not want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they could not answer "Who is the manufacturer of the brain of the scientist?" That they could not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> You have said in one of your tapes, "They want to start half way." Like they say, "All of a sudden there is an aeroplane, appeared in the sky." They do not trace out where that aeroplane is coming from. So similarly, they are interested in the problems of today, but they do not want to delve into the essential problem. They are talking about building nice houses, using this, that. They do not want to delve into...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is practical. The scientists have got good brain, but who manufactured the brain? You cannot do. You have not manufactured your brain. If you say, "By nature," then nature is more powerful than you. But nature is dead. It cannot create life. That is in the hand of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> As soon as the question of <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> living entity, there, this, mine, you can say it is nature. And other things? <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarva... [Bg. </span>3.27].<span class="Italic"> Prakṛti,</span> nature, is doing. Everything explained. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā: [Bs. </span>5.44] "There is an energy which can create, maintain, and destroy the whole cosmic manifestation." <span class="Italic">Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā [Bs. </span>5.44]<span class="Italic">,</span> one. There is one energy. <span class="Italic">Chāyeva yasya vibharti bhuvanāni durgā:</span> "That energy is working just like shadow under the direction of Kṛṣṇa." That is big energy, but that energy... Just like atomic energy, big energy, but it is done by a scientist, not that the ingredients automatically mix together and become an atomic... No. That is not possible. Big, big brain, scientist, they are dealing. Similarly this big energy-creation, maintenance, and destruction of nature-that nature is called Durgā. Durgā. <span class="Italic">Duḥ. Duḥ</span> means difficult, and <span class="Italic">gā</span> means going or to understand. To understand the laws of material nature is very difficult. That is called Durgā. Or Durgā means... Durgā means this is like a fort. We are kept within this, and the superintendent is Durgā. Therefore Durgā's picture is ten hands, ten directions with different kinds of weapon protecting. <span class="Italic">Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā, icchānu... [Bs. </span>5.44]. Now the conclusion. <span class="Italic">Icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā:</span> "She is working not independently, according to the desire of somebody else." Who is that somebody? <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **:</span> "That is Govinda. I am worshiping Him." And this is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sūyate sa-carācaram<br class="calibre2"/>hetunānena kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>jagad viparivartate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.10]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">What is the use of...? Why should we go to research? Everything is there. Our position is very safe. We get the perfect knowledge without wasting our time. We take from Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Finish. We know everything. Just like so many scientists, so many psychology, psychiatrist, and religionist, they come to me, but I am neither of them. I never was a scientist nor I am a psychologist nor a psychiatrist nor this or that. But I speak on the strength of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā;</span> I defeat them. It is practical. So many people came to me but nobody went unharmed. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Digvijāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we are getting perfect knowledge from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Their question may be, what would you advise them to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... This, this boy, Svarūpa Dāmodara. He has written this book, hearing me, hearing me, hearing me... [break] ...addition, alteration. Therefore we present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> no addition, alteration. The same thing. As soon as there is addition, alteration, it is gone, finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, aren't you presenting Kṛṣṇa consciousness according to time, place, and circumstances?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So what enables a person to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... But principle is that you try to understand that you are not this body. That is applicable in all time, all circumstances, all, for everyone. It is not that formerly one had to learn that he's not this body, and now that is not required. The same problem is there still. Arjuna, five thousand years ago he was given lesson about this, that "You are not this body; you are soul." The same problem is now also for the foolish person because the foolish person will always remain in the world, and the intelligent man is to teach him. This is fact always, without any consideration of time, space, and circumstance. There will be certain class of men, foolish, and there will be certain class of men who are intelligent. So the foolish man has to take intelligence from the intelligent man. This is perpetually truth in this material world. It is not, time and circumstances changes this principle. There will be foolish men. Just like now we read, "Two classes of men are there always, the demons and the demigods." So at the present moment more demons. Two classes of men are there always, but at the present moment the demons, number of demons, are more and number of demigods are less because it is Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, does this possible anyhow to teach consciousness in Russian and the country who are in the unitary trust in the East? Like here in the west or America and Australia, in the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> His question is... He is... This boy is Yugoslavian, Yugoslavian, and he has done some translating of your <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> into Yugoslavian. So he is wondering is it possible to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Yugoslavia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> And in other Russian... But these countries are all under Communist rule. It is very difficult in those countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not difficult. Nothing is difficult. For the time being it is difficult but in due course of time it will be very easy. Now who knew that in Europe and America or all over the world, Hare Kṛṣṇa will go on? Bon Mahārāja left the field; others left the field. You see? Other swamis came. They talked all nonsense, yoga, this and that, nose pressing, eyes pressing-all finished. Now Hare Kṛṣṇa is going on. Now people, the nose-presser and eyes-presser, they are no more important. Is it not? Eh? Now our men go and challenge these rascals. And in New York they did it, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are afraid of our troops. (laughter) They are afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> One of those nose-pressers, he once was speaking, and he said, "These Hare Kṛṣṇa people, they like me very much. They always come to my lectures and they sell all the books, all their books, and then they go away before I start to talk."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "You go on pressing your nose. We make our business and go away." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He was speaking like that because our men go into the lecture dressed in disguise, plain clothes, and we are going in the audience selling books to everyone. They all get the book, and then, when he begins to speak, then we all turn around and go out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they did it in the Guru Maharaji's camp also. Hundreds of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is</span> sold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Thousands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thousands. So we take advantage of this meeting. We do our business and go away. And they have no books. They have simply that pressing of nose, that's all, nothing else. They have no philosophy, nothing of the sort. What they will write? They have no philosophy. Simply cheat that "Press your nose; you get Bhagavān." That's all. And people think, "It is so easy. Why shall I go to Bhaktivedanta Swami? Let me go to this Guru Mahārāja." They think like that. And some of our men, feeling too much pressure, they go away. But here there is nothing cheap, that simply by pressing nose and eyes and you become God. Don't make compromise. This principle must be observed. Then you'll remain strong. As soon as you make compromise, then it is finished. <span class="Italic">Dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span> What is that? <span class="Italic">Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ. Namasyantaś ca māṁ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cāru:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, ah. That <span class="Italic">dṛḍha-vratāḥ</span> must be there, strong determination. Then it will go on. The scientists will come to learn and the psychiatrists will come to learn if you keep <span class="Italic">dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span> And as soon as you make compromise, then nobody will care for.
