<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>January 9, 1976, Madras</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ..."Please, everyone join and say, <span class="Italic">'Rāma ki jaya.' </span>" Nobody.... Complete silence. Again he said, "Everyone say, <span class="Italic">'Sai Rāma,</span>' " and somebody yelled out, "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa," and the whole audience said, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," then he said "Hare Kṛṣṇa." (dog barking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">Sai Rāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Big Māyāvādī. And later on he had a very nice program for us. But the first day we visited-as I said, that he plays with snakes-so as we were leaving I said to Yaśodānandana Mahārāja, "I didn't see any snakes." He says, "Didn't you see that man on the <span class="Italic">āsana</span>? (Prabhupāda laughs) That big one?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> That was just between ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Then he had a program with us, and he was chanting. He was a very nice man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> He came and danced with us also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And all the <span class="Italic">Śaivite brāhmaṇas</span> doing the <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> they came and danced with us like ghosts, like madmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, that is not very much liked by others. What do you think, huh? When you say that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, it is not very much liked by others. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Everyone likes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone likes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Except the Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They may not like, but they cannot prove the contrary. They cannot prove that Kṛṣṇa is not the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Even in cinema, when they see the picture of Kṛṣṇa, the audience will feel very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Our cinema or on the outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Ordinary cinemas also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There is one actor who always plays Kṛṣṇa, N.T. Ramaram. So once he came on the street and everyone came following him and touching his feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Because they thought he was Kṛṣṇa. Because they saw him playing Kṛṣṇa in every movie. So he had hundreds of people following him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">yata āyur-vyayaḥ param.</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja said, <span class="Italic">tat prayāsaṁ na kartavyam:</span> "This kind of endeavor you should not do, exploitation." Not exploitation. I mean to say, unnecessarily trying for developing economic condition. The modern civilization is: "Exploit nature and materially be opulent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> It has been seen everywhere we travel that there is plenty of rice everywhere, there is plenty of food growing everywhere, but yet the government is advertising that there is scarcity of food in everything. But there is plenty growing everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And reduce population, kill it. Hiraṇyakaśipu was doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Birth control?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Prajāpati. He stopped Prajāpatis to beget children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> They said they are giving employment to many people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> The government says they are giving employment by opening these mica mines and so many things. The government says they are giving employment and work to many people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So you like to be employed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In one mine recently there was a big cave-in, and how many people...? Three hundred men were killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mica mine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Coal. In...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bihar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Bihar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> [break] In Bangalore, when I was meeting one person and encouraging to become a member, he was telling that among the Durgā worships, one of the Durgā forms called Śānti Dūrga is under the mode of goodness worship. I just want some clarification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sattva-guṇa</span> is also <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Somebody asked, "There is a <span class="Italic">Maṅgala-gaurī.</span>" So I said, "That means there must be some other <span class="Italic">Gaurīs</span> who are not <span class="Italic">maṅgala.</span> Why they have specified that this <span class="Italic">Gaurī</span> is <span class="Italic">Maṅgala-gaurī.</span> Then other <span class="Italic">Gaurīs</span> are not <span class="Italic">maṅgala.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">saṁhitā</span> we understand, <span class="Italic">sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya.</span> The <span class="Italic">pralaya</span> is <span class="Italic">amaṅgala,</span> and <span class="Italic">sṛṣṭi</span> is <span class="Italic">maṅgala. Sthiti</span> is also <span class="Italic">maṅgala.</span> So <span class="Italic">Gaurī</span> has got three functions, Durgā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> [break] A devotee who has tasted the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord can never, if he falls down, can never forget it. Does it mean that his journey in the material world is finished, I mean, is about to finish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Answer, somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> What was the question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> A person who has tasted the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord, if he falls down he can never forget anything. He doesn't act like an ordinary <span class="Italic">karmī.</span> Does that mean that his journey in the material world is about to finish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He falls down due to certain offenses, but afterwards, by the mercy of a pure devotee, he comes back. Because he has tasted the nectar of devotional service, he may try to enjoy the material world for some time. But afterwards he will be fed up again and come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that if one is engaged in the service of the Lord, even if he falls down, he is to be considered saintly. <span class="Italic">Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if it is accidental. If it is purposefully, then he is not saintly; then he is offender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvaja(?):</span> Accidentally means that <span class="Italic">māyā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Accident.... He had former habit, and unknowingly he has done something wrong. That is accident. That is explained by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Not purposefully doing wrong. That is <span class="Italic">aparādha. Nāmnād balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The Deities' name is Rādhā-Parthasarathi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The name of the Delhi Deities is Rādhā-Parthasarathi. So how do we understand? Because Partha means Arjuna. So Rādhā, how does Rādhā get there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When Kṛṣṇa is Parthasarathi, Rādhā is out of Him? Does it mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> What you mean, Parthasarathi is Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Yes. <span class="Italic">Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir āhlādini-śaktir.</span> When He is fighting, the <span class="Italic">āhlādini-śakti</span> is there. It is not manifest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> [break] ...they have Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā-Rukmiṇī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Rādhā, Rukmiṇī, and Kṛṣṇa. So won't Kṛṣṇa feel embarrassed to stand between Rādhā and Rukmiṇī at the same time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Why? Why embarrassed? Two sides? One side, Rādhā...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. One side, Rādhā, one side, Rukmiṇī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that bona fide, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I don't find any fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It's not <span class="Italic">rasābhāsa</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Not <span class="Italic">rasābhāsa.</span> But it is not mentioned in anywhere. This is mental.... They should not have done like that. Several times He requested the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> I think, that "You come to Dvārakā," but they refused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The <span class="Italic">gopī-candana</span> comes from the lake where they say the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> drowned themselves, and that is near Dvārakā. Is that a true story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe they might have gone. [break] ...these houses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> These private houses given by the government. (end)</div>
