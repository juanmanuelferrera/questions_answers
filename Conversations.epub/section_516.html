<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with Indian Guests<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>March 13, 1975, Tehran</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Meeting was very successful. You were present in Delhi? Very, very successful. All big, big men came, and they realized. We are going to have again that for two days. That is being arranged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In Delhi, yes. That will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who is thinking in that way...? We are thinking like that. Keep it covered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> On the table there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (Child talking and Prabhupāda says something in Hindi) Dr. Ghora (?), you can say. The aim should be <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.</span> But if we don't care for this proposition... They do not know what is God, neither we don't want to satisfy Him, "He may be satisfied or not satisfied. Let us go on with our business." (Hindu)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> A lot of dangers will be there. We'll be putting ourself into trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are in trouble. Even last war, when the trouble was too much, they began to go to the church. Even Churchill. And one gentleman-he is my Godbrother in Germany-he told me, after this war many German men and women became atheist. Everyone went to the church and prayed. Especially women prayed for return of their husband, brother, father. And nobody returned. So they thought, "There is no God. So forget about all these things." People became atheist. So this risky civilization is going on. They don't want to know what is God, neither they want to satisfy Him. And our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is just the opposite, that "Here is God. You satisfy Him." That's all. "Never mind what you are, but by your occupational duty you satisfy Him. That is perfection." This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And this is taught in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Kṛṣṇa ultimately said this: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the beginning He said, <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi yat juhoṣi yad aśnāsi yat tapasyasi kuruṣva tad mad arpaṇam: [Bg. 9.27]</span> "Do it for Me." <span class="Italic">Yat karoṣi.</span> It doesn't matter what you are doing. And very good work or bad work or anything, when He says, <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi,</span> means "Whatever you are doing, do it, but the result give Me." <span class="Italic">Kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam.</span> This is His desire. And at last again He said that <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> This is the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and if somebody would say that "Simply I have to satisfy You? Then I have to satisfy others also. If I do not do, then I will be sinful," that, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "Don't worry. If there is any reaction, not doing other duty, simply to surrender to Me, and if there is sinful reaction, then I'll give you protection. Don't worry." This is the conclusion. And we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, that's all, without any malinterpretation. Everyone is interpreting in his own way. But we are not interpreting. We are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. And it is becoming effective. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was studied in the Western countries since a long time, since seventeenth century-but not like this. Before me, many swamis, yogis, they came to the Western countries, and most of them spoke on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but not a single person was a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. But now they are becoming by hundreds because the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is presented as it is. This is the comparison. We have got Christians, Mohammedans, then Buddhist, Africans. Everyone we have got in our society, all very devout executor of our mission. Now here is Mr. Attar. Now he is Atreya Ṛṣi. Whatever he is earning, he is spending for Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.</span> He is trying to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. So in the dictionary it is stated, "Kṛṣṇa is a Hindu god." He is not a Hindu god; He is God. But He appeared in India. He remained in the Vedic culture. Lord Buddha was also Hindu. And he was in Vedic culture. Later on he spread his own mission. That is also Hindu culture, <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā,</span> nonviolence. Lord Buddha... <span class="Italic">keśava dhṛta-buddha.</span> The same Kṛṣṇa, His powerful <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> Lord Buddha. <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare.</span> We offer our prayers to Lord Buddha. Christ was also for twelve years in India. He... Christ, the word <span class="Italic">Christ</span> and <span class="Italic">kristo,</span> there is similarity. He also propagated love of God. That is Kṛṣṇa. So we are spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and you are all Indians. It is your duty to see that the movement is pushed forward. <span class="Italic">Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā:</span> "By your life, by your money, by your good intelligence and by your words." Our mission is to spread the words of Kṛṣṇa. We don't manufacture anything. Why should we manufacture? Everything is there perfectly. What Kṛṣṇa says, it is perfect. If I manufacture something, that is imperfect because I am imperfect. So how can I speak perfectly, or how can I give perfect knowledge? It is not possible because I am defective, I commit mistake, I am sometimes illusioned. Why sometimes? Practically always. Everyone is thinking that he is this body-he is Indian, he is American, he is Hindu, he is Muslim. That is illusion. He is not this body. Similarly, our senses are imperfect, and so long we are in the imperfect condition, if we teach, that means we cheat. I have no perfect knowledge, and still, I am trying to teach. That is cheating. Nobody should try to preach with imperfect knowledge. That is cheating. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra: bhrama, pramāda, vipralipsā</span> and <span class="Italic">kāraṇa-patāvā.</span> We are qualified with these imperfections, and therefore we cannot manufacture. Somebody says "in my opinion." So what is the value of your opinion? You are imperfect. If the child says "in my opinion," what is the value? Therefore we don't say, "in my opinion," "our opinion." We say "Kṛṣṇa says this," that's all. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is... He says,</div>
<div class="Verse">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa<br class="calibre2"/>yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He says that "All of you, you become guru." Just like I am requesting all Indians outside that I am alone trying to spread this Indian culture, why not you also join? You also become guru. So how to become guru? Not that simply by advertising that one has become guru all of a sudden, no. Guru means, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> Whomever you meet, you just instruct him in what Kṛṣṇa says, that's all. You become guru. It is not very difficult to become guru, provided we simply preach the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. That we are doing. We do not say that we are perfect, we have become God, or we have so many, so many magic jugglery. No, we have nothing to do, that. No magic, no jugglery, no God. Simply to become servant of God, and whomever we meet, we speak the words of God, that's all. Then you become guru. This is our mission. That we may be imperfect, that doesn't matter. We are imperfect. Just like this child, he is imperfect. Everyone knows. But if he says, "My father has informed me that this is microphone," so this knowledge of "is microphone" is perfect because he has received from the father, experienced father. And before hearing from the father, he may not know that this is microphone, but since he has heard from the father that this is microphone, and if he says to others that "My father has said, 'This is microphone,' " then people will accept this is perfect knowledge. So we should follow this instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you, every one of you, can become guru. You may say that "I am not interested to become a guru," but Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that if you are not interested, that is not very good. You should be interested. You must be guru. That is success of your life. You can speak the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, even to your family. That also guru. You are actually guru. The father or the head of the family is guru to the children, to the wife. In India still, the wife addresses the husband as <span class="Italic">pati-guru.</span> And father is guru. That is natural. So why don't you become real guru to your wife, to your children, and instruct <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is? This is our mission. You sit down in the evening, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and teach little instruction from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> See how the life changes. Is that very difficult task? <span class="Italic">Boliye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do that. Don't approach the cheater guru, bluffer guru, and be cheated. Stop this business. This has spoiled the whole spiritual atmosphere of the world. Take guru, the supreme guru, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, when in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> when Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira performed <span class="Italic">rājasūya yajña,</span> in the <span class="Italic">rājasūya yajña</span> one person is elected the chief guest. So in that <span class="Italic">yajña</span> many big, big demigods were present, and Bhīṣmadeva was present, Vyāsadeva was present, and many, many other saintly person, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> from the whole universe were present. And Kṛṣṇa was decided to be accepted as the... Everyone agreed to accept Him as the chief guest. And the Śiśupāla, he protested. Then everyone was angry to kill him. So Kṛṣṇa is accepted the guru by everyone. By our <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> recent <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya... I am not speaking of the loafer class, but those who are recognized <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Śaṅkarācārya... They accepted Kṛṣṇa as the supreme guru. Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So accept Kṛṣṇa as the supreme guru and follow His instruction and try to convince others. "Others" means even your family members. That is success of life. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.</span> Why should you lead your life blindly? This human life is meant for enlightenment, supreme enlightenment, and this is supreme enlightenment, to understand the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and preach it as far as you can. If not, you can preach amongst your family members. This is perfection of life. What is that verse? <span class="Italic">Ya imaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati.</span> That is the desire of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Nitai:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhakteṣu abhidhāsyati<br class="calibre2"/>bhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvā<br class="calibre2"/>mām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg 18.68]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Next? <span class="Italic">Na ca tasmān...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitai:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>bhavitā na ca me tasmād<br class="calibre2"/>anyaḥ priyataro bhuvi<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.69]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be anyone more dear."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the easiest process, that you learn <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Don't misinterpret. There is no question of misinterpretation. They, by their, what is called, crippled mind, they misinterpret. Otherwise there is no question of. Where is the difficulty to understand? So Kṛṣṇa says, "Anyone who preaches this Kṛṣṇa philosophy, He is My dearmost person." So if you are recognized by Kṛṣṇa, then that is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.</span> That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Boliye.</span> Any question? (Pause) No question? <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> There must be <span class="Italic">paripraśna,</span> yes or no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Well, the question was the satisfaction of the God, that we satisfy our Lord. Now, what are the means to satisfy the Lord?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That He says: that you preach, you become guru. That is already explained. <span class="Italic">Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣu abhidhāsyati</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is... He says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there. Where is the difficulty? If I say that "You do this. I will (be) satisfied," you do that; you will satisfy me. What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> And the part where you, which you said to preach Kṛṣṇa's... to attain the satisfaction of..., but what you have already said, that one should first know himself first, basic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> What Kṛṣṇa stands and what Kṛṣṇa means in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Why don't you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Yes. When we say we start preaching, so first one... somebody has to know himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Then he can come forward for preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you know yourself? Why you are in darkness? Kṛṣṇa says everything in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> In the beginning He says, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> In this body there is the occupier of the body. So if you think yourself that you are this body, that is your wrong. You try to understand that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span>" That's the fact. So this human life is meant for that purpose. So why should you not do it? Why should you keep yourself in darkness? That is very risky. If I keep myself in the darkness like cats and dogs, that "I am this body," then my life is very risky. By nature's way we are given this opportunity, human form of life. If we do not understand our position, if we remain in the same category, bodily concept of life, then we are missing the chance. After all, you have to change this body. It is not permanent settlement that you shall remain Indian, you shall remain American. No. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> You have to change. Now what kind of body you are going to get, that you have to understand. That is responsibility. So this child, this boy, if he remains in darkness that he will continue this childhood body, and father, mother will take care of him-"I don't require to take any education"-then future life, when he will be young man, he will be not nicely posted for want of education. Then how miserable it will be. Similarly, if we don't take care of this education that "I am not this body, my future body will be different, and if I do not know what kind of different body I'll have to accept..." Suppose we accept some lower grade of body. Then what is my future? So if we don't understand this philosophy as Kṛṣṇa teaches, <span class="Italic">asmin dehe dehinaḥ,</span> "Within this body there is the occupier, soul," so if you do not understand, that is very risky life. Nature's way must go on. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> We cannot control over the nature's way. And we get our next body according to the association of different modes of nature. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya.</span> Everything is there. Why do you not study? Why you remain in darkness? What is this life? Is that very good life? You, what is your name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Mr. Sahani.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sahani, yes. Mr. Sahani, do you think is that very nice life, to remain in darkness for our future life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Not at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. (says something in Hindi regarding <span class="Italic">daṇḍavat</span>) (chuckles) That is very good. That is our process. <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya-pūrvaka-nāma-gana-natibhiḥ.</span> The Vaiṣṇavas, they chanted with a numerical strength, <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-pūrvaka. Sāṅkhya-pūrvaka-nāma-gana-natibhiḥ. Nāma</span> means chanting of the holy name. <span class="Italic">Gana</span> means also prayer. And also <span class="Italic">daṇḍavat.</span> Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, he took vow that "So many times I will offer <span class="Italic">daṇḍavat.</span>" So these things are... If this child simply offers <span class="Italic">daṇḍavat</span> to the Vaiṣṇava or Viṣṇu, so it will not go in vain. Even if he does not know any <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> simply offers obeisances, that will also be taken into credit. It is so nice thing. <span class="Italic">Sāṅkhya-pūrvaka-nāma-gana-natibhiḥ kālāvasāni-kṛtau.</span> So therefore Deity worship is recommended. So if anyone does not know anything, if he simply comes and offers obeisances, that is also nice. Therefore Deity worship is important for the common man. Even if he does not know anything, if he simply comes and offer obeisances, if he little dances with <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> everything will be taken into credit. Then one day he will become a devotee. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> the so-called <span class="Italic">jñānavān</span> they do not care for the Deity-puffed up. But Kṛṣṇa says this class of <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> after many, many births, when he'll be actually <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> he will offer obeisance. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is so difficult and easy. A <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> after many, many births, come to this conclusion, "Here is <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> I offer my obeisances." And the same obeisances can be offered by a child without being <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> but the result is the same. If you touch fire after studying the physics and chemistry, and without studying physics and chemistry if you touch fire, the result is the same. So our request to everyone is not to keep oneself in darkness and spoil the boon of human life, but try to understand your position and try to understand how to satisfy the Supreme. Everything is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is the summary of all Vedic literatures. This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And if you try to preach, then you become most recognized person of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Na ca tasmāt manuṣyeṣu kaścit me priya kṛtta...</span> And our mission is to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.</span> And He says, "In this way I become most satisfied." Then where is the difficulty? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> ...our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is there any different methods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, methods I have all explained. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhakta</span> means do what Kṛṣṇa says. That is Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇanu-śilānam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like Arjuna did. He did not like to fight with his cousin-brothers, but after hearing instruction of Kṛṣṇa, he said, "Yes," <span class="Italic">naṣṭo mohaḥ,</span> "my illusion is now over." <span class="Italic">Smṛtir labdhā:</span> "I have got my consciousness." <span class="Italic">Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava: [</span>Bg. 18.73] "I shall act as You are saying, that's all." This is Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> We may have different decisions. That is natural. But when you agree to abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa, then your life is perfect. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So you have to agree. Kṛṣṇa does not force; He says, "Do this like this," and if we agree, then we are Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Can you satisfy equally as <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> or <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span> Can you satisfy equally in whatever path you have chosen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. The satisfaction is the point. So just like the head of the family, he is asking his wife to do something, children to do something, servant to do something. So if they are doing according to the order, then it is very nice. The head of the family is satisfied, and everything is going nicely. Anywhere, in office also. There are different officers, secretaries, managers, and the director. He has given: "You do this. You do that. You do that. You do that." So if they do their duty, then everything is nice. Just like in your body. Here also we have got different parts. The hand does something, the leg something, the belly something, the brain something. What the brain does, the leg does not do. But the leg is doing for the satisfaction of the whole body. The brain is doing for the satisfaction of the whole body. Hand is doing for the satisfaction of the whole body. That is required, not that what is brain doing, the leg has to do the same. The leg may do his own way, but the aim is satisfaction of the order of the... I ask the leg, "Please take me from this room to that room." That is leg's duty. I am satisfied. So not that Kṛṣṇa is only one-sided. That they do not understand. Kṛṣṇa is the <span class="Italic">īśvara,</span> controller of the whole creation. So if He gives you something to do for His satisfaction, you do that. It does not matter whether you are doing the same thing. The same example: Leg is doing something else than the hand, hand is doing something else than the brain, but the real purpose is to satisfy the whole. So Kṛṣṇa is not asking Vyāsadeva to come and fight in the battlefield of Kurukṣetra. Vyāsadeva is doing his own work. He is writing literature, Vedavyāsa. He is asking Arjuna to fight. But although the activities are different-Vyāsadeva is writing <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> and Arjuna is fighting-but both of them are equally important. Kṛṣṇa says Arjuna, <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si:</span> "You are My very dear friend," and <span class="Italic">priyo 'si</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 4.3]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Therefore I shall speak to you about this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>." Kṛṣṇa did not say, "Call Vyāsadeva. I have to speak <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He is learned scholar." No. Arjuna was not a learned scholar; he was a warrior. And he was a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> busy in politics. Still, He called Arjuna, "Yes, I shall speak to you <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span>" Why? <span class="Italic">Bhakto 'si:</span> "You are My devotee." So to become devotee doesn't require that one has to become very big scholar or very rich man. No. Simply you have to agree, "Yes, Sir, what You say I shall do," that's all. This is <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> To become <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> is not very difficult thing. You simply agree, "Kṛṣṇa, what You say, I shall do," that's all. <span class="Italic">Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is, perfection. So Kṛṣṇa wants this. This is the common formula for all. <span class="Italic">Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣu abhidhāsyati</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Anyone who speaks about this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān pari...,</span> he is very dear to Me." So agree to that proposal, that "We shall speak to everyone about this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as Kṛṣṇa has spoken." Then you become a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> That's all. You can do it in your office. You can do in your home. Kṛṣṇa does not say that "First of all you become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> and you change your dress and become like these Kṛṣṇa conscious men." No. You remain in your position. But do this. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's... <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitaḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.</span> You remain in your place, <span class="Italic">sthane sthitaḥ.</span> Simply you hear from Kṛṣṇa or from Kṛṣṇa's representative and do it, that's all. Where is the difficulty? <span class="Italic">Boliye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> No difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is my request that you are so many respectable Indian gentlemen here, and we are preaching Kṛṣṇa's message. You come forward. You learn more and join this mission. It is not meant for Mr. Attar; it is meant for everyone, especially for the Indians. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that also, <span class="Italic">bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">. Bhārata-bhūmite</span> means in the land of Bhāratavarṣa. <span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhūmi</span> is considered <span class="Italic">puṇya-bhūmi.</span> So you are fortunate that you have taken birth as human being in India. It is the result of much pious activities. Indians are naturally Kṛṣṇa conscious. Now this gentleman, Mr. George, what is his name, full name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> John(?) (Jordon?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. The Canadian ambassador. He came to see me. He saw me in Delhi when our function was going on. He was speaking; he was so surprised. So this movement has got good potency, and every one of you join.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari 'kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> The whole world is in darkness without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So enlighten them, <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> Human life is for <span class="Italic">para-upakāra;</span> it is not animal life. To do good to others. Cats and dogs, they are selfish. But human life should be for <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> So this is the biggest <span class="Italic">para-upakāra</span> movement. And it is very easy to take part in it. You don't require to be very expert. You... Everything is there. You simply carry the message like peon. Kṛṣṇa says this; kindly follow; that's all. We don't say that "I say this. I have manufactured this. I have become very big man, God." We don't say nonsense. It is all nonsense. Simply carry the message of Kṛṣṇa; then you are perfect. In the Western countries they are little fond of yoga. So the yoga system is also spoken by Kṛṣṇa in the Sixth Chapter. But the conclusion is, when Arjuna refused, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me. This meditation, this <span class="Italic">praṇāyāma</span> and <span class="Italic">dhyāna, dhāraṇā, yama, niyama, dhyāna,</span> it is not possible for me. I am a politician. I have no time either"-he said frankly-then Kṛṣṇa satisfied him that "You are already the best of the yogis."</div>
<div class="Verse">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad-gata āntarātmanā<br class="calibre2"/>śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sa me yuktatamo mataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>6.47]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"You are already yogi, first-class yogi, because you are always thinking of Me." So this is the standard of first-class yogi, to remain always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and try to execute His will, that's all. That is first-class yogi, Kṛṣṇa says. You haven't got to get certificate from anyone else. Kṛṣṇa says. <span class="Italic">Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gata āntarātmanā.</span> Who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">āntarātmānā,</span> that is real yoga. Yoga means <span class="Italic">dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa by <span class="Italic">dhyāna,</span> by meditation, that is real yoga. And Kṛṣṇa says also. He confirms the same, that <span class="Italic">mad-gata āntarātmanā, śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ sa me yuktatamo.</span> Then he is first-class yogi. This bodily exercise is meant for person who is in the bodily concept of life. One who understands that "I am not this body; I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. My duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa," that is first-class yogi. So become first-class yogi, first-class recognized person by Kṛṣṇa. Make your life success. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So what was your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> My question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, question, you question something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It's just people... For example, could the president of the Coca-Cola company find the way to Kṛṣṇa, to serve Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone can serve. Cola company?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Coca-Cola company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Coca-Cola.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Somebody that manufactures a product which is basically destructive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Coca-Cola company... Of course, we advise... Kṛṣṇa advises, <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi.</span> It includes Coca-Cola company. But He said <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi:</span> "Whatever you do." Kṛṣṇa said, "Whatever you do." So that includes all kinds of activities. But will the Coca-Cola company agree to give the profit to Kṛṣṇa? Then he is Kṛṣṇa conscious. The profit he will enjoy for his wine and woman, that's all, not for Kṛṣṇa. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Can the profit of the manufacture of something which is manufactured purely for profit be turned to good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if he gives to Kṛṣṇa. Just like Arjuna. He fought. He killed. Killing is not good business, but he killed on the advice of Kṛṣṇa, and he became a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> by killing. Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si.</span> And what did he do? He killed, that's all. This is an example. Of course, <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> never kills. Kṛṣṇa... Arjuna was not willing to kill. But when he saw that "Kṛṣṇa wants it, so this is my first business. Never mind I shall go to hell," that is Kṛṣṇa conscious. "By killing my brother I may go to hell. It doesn't matter. But Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied. That is my first business." Kṛṣṇa sometimes pretended to be sick. And many physicians came, they could not cure Him, headache. So He suggested that "I think if My devotee gives their dust of foot on My head, then I'll be cured." Then every devotee was approached that "Give your dust of feet. Kṛṣṇa wants it." Even Nārada. So Nārada said, "How it is possible I shall give my dust of feet to Kṛṣṇa? No, no, no, it is not possible." But when the person, messenger, approached <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> in Vṛndāvana and they were informed that "Kṛṣṇa is sick. So He wanted the dust of feet of the devotee to be applied on His head. Nobody gave it. So we have come last to you," so immediately: "Yes, yes, take it, take it." Immediately. So so much dust was collected. And Kṛṣṇa was cured. So this is <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> Others thought that "If I give the dust of my feet to Kṛṣṇa, I may go to hell," but the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> thought, "Let us go to hell, but let Kṛṣṇa be cured." Therefore the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are the first-class devotee. They do not care for themselves. That is recommended by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargabhir ya kalpitāḥ:</span> "The process of worship as it was planned by the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> in Vṛndāvana, there is no comparison. That is the highest devotion." They did not care for themself. They simply wanted to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa was playing flute at dead of night, all the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> were flying to Kṛṣṇa. His father, his husband-"Where you are going in this dead of...? Where you are going?" They didn't care. Society, friendship, love-all sacrificed: "We shall go to Kṛṣṇa." This is <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti.</span> That is the highest perfection of life, to sacrifice everything for Kṛṣṇa. "Only Kṛṣṇa should be satisfied." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But that is not very easy job. But one can do if he likes, everything for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says also, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">. Gopīs</span> did not care for social, for religious or family and nothing. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya.</span> They went: "Kṛṣṇa now is calling. Let us go." This is the typical example of <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ.</span> So, of course, it is not possible to become on the standard of <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> That is not possible. But at least we shall try to follow these devotees. Arjuna is there, <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are there, Uddhavas are there-many devotees. Lord Brahmā is there. Lord Śiva is there. Kapiladeva is there. The four Kumāras are there. Bhīṣmadeva is there. Prahlāda Mahārāja is there. Janaka Mahārāja is there. Śukadeva Gosvāmī is there. So <span class="Italic">mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> If we simply follow these big, big devotees, then our life is successful. For authorized persons' name, to follow them:</div>
<div class="Verse">svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prahlādo bhīṣmo janako<br class="calibre2"/>balir vaiyāsakir vayam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 6.3.20]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Twelve: Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Nārada, then the four Kumāras, then Kapiladeva, then Prahlāda Mahārāja, Bhīṣma, Janaka Mahārāja, Vyāsadeva, er, no, Vaiyāsakī, son of Vyāsadeva. Not Vyāsadeva-son of Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Bali Mahārāja and Yamarāja. These twelve <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> we can follow them. <span class="Italic">Sarvātmā snapane baliḥ.</span> Bali Mahārāja gave everything to Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
