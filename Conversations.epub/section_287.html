<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So Mr. Popworth you know, and Mr. Schumacher will be up in a second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you came here before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, that's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> My invariable reply, sir, is that I am dying slowly. I trust you are well, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Old man, struggling. Spiritual consciousness is not dependent on material impediments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> I'm not hearing these beautiful words. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> He remarked that the spiritual consciousness is not impeded by material impediments-like the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> I discovered that when I was a cook. I used to have to peel a huge bath full of potatoes every day, hours and hours, and it became that I could peel the potatoes without being aware that I was handling them. And my mind was roaming, disembodied almost from any encumbrance. But this is not the same as meditation, I'm sure, as you see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your idea of meditation? (Someone comes in.) Come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Sit over here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vicitravīrya:</span> This is Dr. Schumacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Thank you very much for your coming. I have read some of your ideas. So from your writing it appears you are nice, thoughtful man. <span class="Italic">Muni,</span> the Sanskrit word is <span class="Italic">muni.</span> Just like Nārada Muni. They are very thoughtful. So I have read one description of, "Crisis of Increasing Motor Cars," in this paper. Actually, we are creating a crisis. This advancement of modern civilization is simply creating crisis. One Vaiṣṇava poet, he has sung: <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga chāḍi kainu asatye vilāsa. Sat-saṅga</span> means spiritual association. So we have given up spiritual association, and <span class="Italic">asatye vilāsa,</span> we have taken to material enjoyment. So <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga chāḍi kainu...</span> There are two things, material and spiritual. So <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga chāḍi kainu asatye...</span> "I have given up spiritual association, and I have taken to material association. Therefore I have become entangled." <span class="Italic">Sei karaṇe lāgilā mora karma-bandha-phāṅsā.</span> We are becoming more and more entangled in material activities. We are trying to solve one problem, and creating another big problem. Just like I was reading the "Motor Car Crisis." We thought that with a horseless carriage it will be very convenient to travel. But against that convenience, so-called convenience, we have created so many inconveniences. It is very nicely described in that paper I was reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Was it this one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's a reprint, "Economics of Permanence," your essay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's called "The Economics of Permanence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "The Motor Car Crisis"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Is it mentioned in that essay? I think it must be a different location.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vicitravīrya:</span> I think it was in one of the <span class="Italic">Resurgence</span> magazines, perhaps. It was in one of the eight magazines, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. Here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> The one on Buddhist economics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> No, it was the other one. This is "The Economics of Permanence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. "Cars, Profits and Pollution." I was just reading this article. "Cars, Profits and Pollution." So this one side, we make profit, another side, we make pollution. This is the material, result of material activities. Whatever you do. Anything you do material, it is same. In one side, you see, "Oh, there is so much profit," and another side, you'll see so much pollution. Therefore the remedy is to act for spiritual realization. Then you will avoid pollution. The remedy is. If you... That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> in the Third Chapter, how we can work for spiritual realization and avoid the pollution of material activities. This is the sum and substance of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> we do not avoid the material activities, but we become free from the material pollution. This is the secret of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> How do you envisage one should act, if I may ask that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> He said, how do you envisage that one should act. How should one act? He's asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you will find in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like Arjuna. He was a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> a warrior, but he acted on account of Kṛṣṇa. We are acting, but we are acting at the present moment for our sense gratification. Everyone is thinking that "If I do like this, it will give me great satisfaction." That is my sense gratification. I am acting for my satisfaction, not for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction. So when we act for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, that is the perfection. Then we save the material pollution. This is the secret. Arjuna is a good example. Before fighting, he was thinking in terms of his own satisfaction. But when he understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and he agreed to act for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, then he became perfect. So our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so nice that we do not say immediately to stop. Just like "Cars, Profits and Pollution," the very nice description of these three things. But there is no suggestion of remedy. That he does not know. If he suggested remedy, "Now stop all cars driving," or "Stop this nonsense business," that is impossible. That is craziness. So we do not say that you stop it. But we say, purify it. Just like there is pollution. So pollution is there. You cannot stop manufacturing cars or driving cars. That is not possible. But you can purify the pollution. That is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> It's possible to what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> Purify the pollution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. <span class="Italic">Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.</span> So everything should be done-that is called <span class="Italic">karma-yoga-</span>in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Under the direction of Kṛṣṇa. Just like Arjuna is doing. He did not change his position as a fighter, as a warrior. But he acted according to the direction of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he is recognized: <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si priyo 'si</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 4.3]<span class="Italic">.</span> "You are My dear friend. You are My devotee." This is the process. So we have to purify. We cannot stop. That is not possible. The progress which is going on, let it go. But let it go, we do not want that, but it has come so far, it is not possible to stop it. But here is the remedy. You can purify it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> What means do you suggest for purifying it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The means is that... Our process is that wherever we go, we perform <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> chant the holy name of God. That purifies, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> It doesn't matter where it is. Even if we... We can go to the factory. Anywhere. We can go to the hell even. By, but this process, it is a very simple thing, chanting the holy name of the Lord. So what possible objection can there be? Suppose if we go to a motor car factory, and we ask them, "Please give us some chance. We shall chant here the holy name of the Lord." What their, what is the possible objection? You are very thoughtful man. You can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> I don't see the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? There cannot be any objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So let us get this chance. Simple method. So we'll go. Let us go everywhere, hell or heaven. It doesn't matter. Let us have this chance and speak something about God. That's all. And we don't want anything from you in exchange, that "You give us some money." No. We don't want. If you give us something, welcome. It will be used for Kṛṣṇa's service. But we don't demand anything, that "First of all give me a hundred dollars, then I shall go." No. So... From the other side, there is no loss. But if they give us the chance for prosecuting, for pursuing, this Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement, everything will be purified. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni... [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> All problems will be solved. This is the beginning. Now, gradually, as people understand this philosophy, they will understand. They will understand. If they simply give us the chance. <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitāḥ.</span> Let them remain in their position. We don't disturb. We don't disturb. <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.</span> Simply they will kindly give their aural reception what we are speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> Well, the diagnostic's not altogether clear to me how the chanting is going to affect the pollution. How do you see...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a purificatory process. Pollution means impure. So if you purify, then there is no more pollution. Just like infection. You have got some disease, infection. If you give some vaccine to purify the body, the infection is gone. It is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It seems that there's a difference in the usage of this word pollution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I think there's a difference in the way the word pollution is being used.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, whatever meaning you may do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So, for instance, if it is used to indicate air pollution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> ...then how will the chanting will affect that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it will affect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> He's asking how.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How? That you do not know. You'll have to realize when you give us the chance. But if you give us the chance, there is no loss on your part. But you'll practically see how it is rectified, how it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vicitravīrya:</span> Pollution is to some extent a result of materialistic activity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vicitravīrya:</span> The pollution, is it to some extent the result of material activity, which will cease when the spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are so many things. What is material activity, what spiritual activity is. These are to be understood. But we are sure, if simply this chance is given, anywhere, let us execute this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> and speaking something from this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We are getting practical result. Just like you were describing, that in communist country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You just explain to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They have a big youth festival there in East Berlin. Maybe you know? "The Festival of Youth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So they have invited youth from all over the world to come and see what they are doing there. So some of our devotees went there just the past week. And they reported to me that at every moment during the day that they were there they were surrounded always by at least three hundred young people who simply stood taking notes and asking questions about this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They want to know what is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, what they are doing. That means that there is some dissatisfaction. They want something. They want something substantial. And they're getting it from Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This philosophy is substantial. It is practical. They are hankering for it. Their so-called communist philosophy is not perfect. It's imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> They were communist youth who were surrounding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> The people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. They were surrounding our devotees and asking questions and taking notes and taking addresses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> But the people who are at the conference are not all communist youth, are they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, whoever they may be, they've gone there with some interest about communism. Otherwise, they would not go there. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness... Actually, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is perfect communism, Prabhupāda always explained, because communism, so-called communism, they give advantage only to the human being, but not to the animals or the other living beings. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is pure, genuine, absolute communism because we recognize that the Supreme... Everyone should work for Kṛṣṇa. Everything should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa is the supreme head of state, and everything is utilized for His purpose, His service. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, "Whatever you do as work, whatever you eat, whatever you give away, you do it for Me." The same philosophy... Communist philosophy is "Everyone works for the state; the state will distribute." Right? But it's imperfect. But here is the perfect thing. Kṛṣṇa, He is the supreme creator, He's the proprietor. Therefore everything must be used for His pleasure. Then it becomes perfect communism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Instead of making the state center, make God center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> Do you think that the Christian monasteries practiced this in the past, or perhaps even today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, today, no one is practicing it. Otherwise why people are leaving the church? No one is in the monastery, no one is in the church. They are abandoning it. Because there is no center. As soon as there is a center, it will carry weight. Just like a wheel. If there's a hub, if there's a hub, that it will carry weight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> I have not abandoned the church. I have embraced it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Anyway, our point is... We're speaking in general. In general, because the center, factually the center, God, is missing, somehow or other, He's missing, therefore people are also giving it up. They can't take it. Because it's not practical. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is practical. It's not a sentiment or a dry philosophy. It's a practical philosophy of life, absolute philosophy of life, how to do everything without any pollution, without any contamination. Just like we are experiencing by our so-called advancement that we have created so many modern facilities for comfort, but the result is, alongside, simultaneously, there's an equal disadvantage. Just like we create a motor car. But we create air pollution. Or you create a highway. But you have to create snowplow to clear the highway. You have to create police. You have to create so many other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there is list of accidents, injuries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And just like yesterday, Mahādeva's parents came here, his mother came here along with a Jesuit family priest, about sixty years old. And she accused us that we had come and kidnapped him out of the university. And we said, "Actually, we didn't kidnap him. He came to our temple and didn't want to go away," which is what happened. She said, "Well, that's because he took some LSD and he had a false religious experience." So then I asked the Jesuit priest, "If your religious experience is as pure as he had just been saying, then why was this boy, trained up in a Jesuit school, seeking after spiritual life from a false religious process? Why was he taking LSD in the first place if his religion was satisfactory?" And he couldn't answer it. He said, "Well, there seems to be some kind of a spiritual," what did he say, "a spiritual lack or a spiritual something at this time for some reason." But he would not define it that he was unable to fill that spiritual lack by his process. And yet, we have filled that lack, or our spiritual master has filled that lack for thousands of young people now, who are not only God conscious, but they're practicing it every minute of every day. And they're practicing it practically, in the city or in the community or in the farm or wherever they are. So it's not that we're contesting the origins. The origin from Christ may have been very pure, but its present manifestation appears to be lacking something. And the young people are seeing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just for example, that in the Ten Commandments, the first Commandment is "Thou shall not kill." So when I ask any Christian gentleman, "Then why you are killing?" they cannot give me any satisfactory answer. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> How does the, how does the process of animal slaughter in the slaughterhouse as we find it today, how does it fit in your philosophy for, say, changing the society? Where do you put that in your philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> Well, I think one should try and do without it. You can't everywhere do without it. It's like all nonviolence. It's a direction of movement, to try to do your utmost to go as far as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So wherever possible, the slaughtering business should not go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> That's right. But the Eskimos, for instance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> That's what I was saying, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When there is no food, so human life is more important than animal life. So the human life should be saved at the sacrifice of animals. That is another question. But where there is complete facilities to get very nice, nutritious food, why these poor animals should be killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But in the last week we've had a Jesuit priest, a Black Friar's monk, several other theologically inclined Christian gentlemen have been here, and not one of them has assented to that statement. They do not agree. They think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not agree that animal killing is sinful. They do not agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> It's a very long question, isn't it. I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is a simple question. Killing, do you think killing is very good business? Then why it is forbidden, "Thou shall not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> No, but sometimes protection is necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. Generally, you should not kill. But when there is absolute necessity, that is another thing. But generally, this killing process you cannot support, and at the same time, you want to make the society purified. You commit sinful activities; at the same time, you want to purify. How it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> I think a society can survive, and spirituality can survive, even among meat-eaters. It's much more difficult, I imagine, that a society can survive which has animal factories. Now, I would be much more interested whether we can get our friends, the Dominicans, the Jesuits, to agree that this kind of a treatment of animals is just so, beyond the pale. This would be, in the European context, I think, a better test than to challenge the habit of meat-eating, which is also intergrown with all sorts of assumptions. I mean there is the ruling assumption that you need it, which I challenge and you challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> See, the habits are one thing. If we understand that it is an undesirable habit, they can be changed. All of us are from meat-eating backgrounds, almost without exception. We've all strictly stopped. We've stopped taking intoxicants. We've stopped gambling and we've stopped illicit sex life, although we were habituated to doing these things, because we came to understand that it was necessary for the advancement of our spiritual life. But the difficulty is that somebody who is so much engrossed in this kind of life, who has made it a pillar of his life, and that by the psychological effect of such habits, he comes to the stage of being so stony-hearted that he does not see the miserable suffering he's putting the animals to unnecessarily. He has no sense for it. Even if it's graphically described to him... I described it to this monk about how conscious the cow is compared to, say, the cauliflower. He couldn't see any difference. No distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> I'm sorry. Distinction between what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The distinction between killing a cow and cutting off a cauliflower from a plant. He said, "Both are alive." Yes, both are alive. But what is the psychological state of a cow, and what is the psychological state of a cauliflower plant? Practically speaking, he has no psychology. No senses, no mind, no ability to feel elation or suffering. But a cow is a completely different condition. Cow is very nearly to human consciousness. Practically the next birth after a cow, according to the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> is a human birth. So you're putting so much suffering unnecessarily. But he had no sense, not... An intelligent man who can sense that "If I suffer, I don't like it," then when he sees another living entity put into suffering, he thinks, "How I could avoid that suffering for that living entity, because I don't like to suffer." But this gentleman had no conception. He's...</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is one moral instruction by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita was a great minister during the time of Mahārāja Candragupta. So he was honorary Prime Minister in the empire. So he has a book of moral instruction. So he says in that moral instruction, who is a learned man. So he gives the description of a learned man, that: <span class="Italic">mātṛvat para-dāreṣu. Mātṛvat.</span> "Just treat all other women except your wife as your mother." <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu, para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat. Loṣṭa</span> means as there are so many pebbles lying on the street, you don't care for it, similarly, others' property, others' money you should treat just like these pebbles lying on the street or the garbage lying on the street. Don't touch it. So <span class="Italic">mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat, ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu.</span> And treat all living entities as you want to be treated. If one has got these three qualifications, he is learned man. He does not say, one who has got this BAC, DAC degrees, and so on, so on, so on. No. The result of his education is to be seen by three manifestations: treating all women as mother; treating others' money, property, as garbage, as rubbish in the street; and treating all living entities as you want to be treated yourself. If one has attained these three development of knowledge, he is learned. There is no question of literary education. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat.</span> So if we covet other's wife, if we eat meat, if we indulge in intoxication, if we indulge in gambling, we are polluting the whole society. So how we can expect purification unless we accept these principles? You cannot ignite fire, at the same time pour water on it. Similarly, if you want to purify the whole society, the first principle should be like this, as Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says,</div>
<div class="Verse">mātṛvat para-dāreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat<br class="calibre2"/>ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>yaḥ paśyati sa paṇḍitaḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Women should be treated as mother. They should be given protection. They should not be advertised for prostitution. All living (beings) should be given protection. This is the government's duty. A king's duty is government duty, that anyone who has taken birth on the land, he must be protected. It doesn't matter whether he's human being or animal or tree. So these are the process of purification. If you don't adopt the process, simply you think the counterside only, there is no wor... So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will purify the whole situation. Therefore we expect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> I wonder if I could put the point which Dr. Schumacher has made somewhat more forcefully if possible. I am surprised that in the exchange the point he made was not taken and answered. What is at issue is that in your beliefs you are saying it is wrong to kill an animal. It is possible, I don't say this to justify the killing of animals. But it is possible for an animal to be killed by a man in a way that involves far less suffering to the animal than it would die in its natural state. But what seems to be such an infinitely greater evil, an infinitely greater crime against the natural order is, for example, to take one chicken and put it in a cage the size of a shoe box, and then add more two more chickens to it, and then keep them there for the whole of their short natural life, unnatural life. But it seems to me, and, I think, to Dr. Schumacher, that this is an abomination of the spirit far greater than the mere killing of animals. But if it... It seems to be an insult against creation to treat the animal life in this manner. And yet, you do not appear to be shocked by it as you are shocked by the mere fact of killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is more shocking than killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> Far more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vicitravīrya:</span> What happens is they have large factories where they have thousands and thousands and thousands of chickens in a very tight space, and they breed them for slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> And young cows, calves are kept in a dark shed, deliberately kept in a dark shed and fed on an unnatural diet. They are not allowed to move, they are just kept in a space the size of their body. And for eight weeks, three months, they are fed on unnatural food, milk powder or something, devoid of certain necessary vitamins, to make the flesh whiter so that it gets a market. But that unfortunate beast, instead of walking in the fields under the open sky, he's shut him down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, if you are so compassionate, you can kill those animals. But why you are maintaining slaughterhouse, killing nice animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, he's talking... He's just saying that the way they're maintaining the slaughterhouse now has become even more inhuman. They don't even leave the animal in the field anymore. They keep him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> One small point. A simple point is that the slaughterhouse activity necessitates to raise them in that way. As soon as there is a question of animal killing, then naturally, you want to be as expedient as possible. So if you abolish the animal killing, automatically this breeding animals in this fashion will also automatically stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> But the slaughterhouse becomes a temple of mercy given these conditions in which the animals are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. As long as you maintain a slaughterhouse, then there'll be people to breed animals to supply to the house of slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> As soon as there's no more slaughterhouse, then the animals are free. They can go everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> I think you are avoiding the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No. It's the solution. If you want to stop that treatment of animals, you stop the slaughterhouse. Otherwise, first you keep them in the field to slaughter. That's already brute mentality. That brute mentality means next I think, "I could get more flesh if I didn't let this cow move. So let me keep him in a case, cage, in the dark so they have lighter meat." This is one stage of brute mentality to another stage of brute mentality. The next stage of brute mentality... They're already killing the unborn child. Now, next, the child is born. That's the next stage of brute mentality. That is predicted in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, their theory is that when the child comes out of the womb, then he gets the soul. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not within the womb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What kind of theory it is? For killing the child within the womb, they have discovered this theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> I think if there is any difficulty... Well, I happen to be a vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> But I would hesitate a long, long time before I would make meat-eating the touchstone on which I would judge a Jesuit. I don't think I could see such a central position. And the evils that are going on that have to be fought are, in comparison with meat-eating, gigantic. And therefore, to refuse to accept that even a meat-eating Jesuit may be a far better man than a vegetarian who is engaged in all sorts of nefarious practices, I think one should be a bit careful. If you come out of a civilization where this has been customary all, all throughout history...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Therefore all throughout history...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> Yes, I know. I haven't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> ...you haven't... Why hasn't there been peace in our civilization? Because we're practicing these four things: meat..., animal killing, intoxication, illicit sex life and gambling. According to Vedic scripture, these four activities are the sum and substance of sinful life, and sinful life means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pollution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Pollution. Or reaction. You're getting... Just like you make an automobile; you get the reaction-air pollution. So if you kill animals, you will be killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> You think like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And intoxication itself means that you are polluted. Toxic means poison. Poison means pollution. So if you indulge in intoxication, everything you do, say and think will be polluted. If you kill animals, the result is you're polluting nature's... There are laws of nature. Animal is part of nature. You're part of nature. So if you disturb nature, that means you're polluting the nature. And you are living in that nature. So you are suffering the reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> The Buddhists have got a good, a good formula on this, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's common sense. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of Buddhist, Christian or Hindu. It is common sense philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> The Buddhists have a good compromise on this. They say you can eat meat...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no strict Buddhist will say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> ...but because you're not allowed to kill animals for eating meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> So they let the Muslims kill the animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Let the Muslims kill, and if I take... If the Muslims kill the animal, and I take the meat, I become animal-killer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> Well, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> If I sell the meat if I cook the meat, if I distribute the meat if I eat the meat I'm the same as the man who slaughters the animal. This is Vedic... There's a Vedic verse that explains it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vicitravīrya:</span> As a matter of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eight kinds of criminals. In killing animals, there are eight kinds of criminals. That he has explained. One who is killing, one who is ordering, one who is purchasing, one who is eating, one who is cooking, in this way... Just like if a man is killed. If a man is killed and there are so many persons implicated, it does not mean that only one who has killed, he becomes criminal. All others who are implicated in that killing business, they are criminals. This is pollution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> This, this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> Let me make myself clear. I happen to be a vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's all right. We understand that. We're talking about the matter, the issue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> But you know, if one lives here in this society, even the elimination of these four things doesn't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Oh, it changes everything immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> I mean a fellow who builds himself a huge house when we have twenty-thousand actually, actually homeless people without a roof over their head in London... Now I would like those things to be raised into real spiritual problems.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> And not to get satisfaction out of making idealistic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, we have such a big place, but why they are not coming? We have temples all over the world, but people are not coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because there are restriction.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Why not? If they have no place to live, let them come and live here. We are convinced that Kṛṣṇa can provide place for any number of His...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> ...devotees. Any number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> I found this the other day, and you'll forgive me making this point, but when I was in discussion, it was impossible for me to make a point without being interrupted so frequently that I failed to make my point at all. Now, can I beg for courtesy for our guest to listen to what he has to say. Then answer him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But... Just that this is interesting, that the solution is there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> But you haven't heard the problem yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But the problem is that people cannot understand the solution. They cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But one thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Why they cannot understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mister, yes... I forgot your name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> John.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> John, Mr. John. That we follow strictly the Vedic injunctions, and unless we become God conscious, there cannot be any reformation in this world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Popworth:</span> I agree with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. And that God consciousness cannot be achieved without being pure. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> God is the supreme pure. You cannot approach God, you cannot understand God, in impure condition. And without God consciousness, there cannot be any purification. You try to understand this simple fact, that without God consciousness, you may prescribe so many things-they will be all failure, all failure. And God consciousness cannot be achieved without being pure. This is the problem. Now you can think over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Schumacher:</span> I agree with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can defend your theory but that will not help purification of the society. That will not help. Take it for granted. You can make so many theories but if you remain impure, if you are not God conscious, all these theories will be useless. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā mano-rathe...</span> [SB 5.18.12]. This is simply mental speculation. <span class="Italic">Mano-rathena,</span> hovering on the mental plane, you can jump from this to that, but that will not solve the problem. <span class="Italic">Mano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ.</span> So we do not act on mental speculation. It may be our credit or discredit. That is different thing. We simply follow the standard policy. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now, everything is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> how to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> how to become a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> how to become a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> how to become a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> or how to remain less important than the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> The societies must be divided in different divisions.

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...there are so many paths, that Kṛṣṇa says that "Real religion is to surrender unto Me. Therefore you give up all this pseudo-religion," <i class="calibre3">sarva dharman parityajya, give it up, mam ekam saranam</i>, "just surrender unto Me, I shall give you protection from all sinful reaction." So here is God, and He is accepted by great ācāryas. In India there were great ācāryas, religious leaders. Just like Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Nimbarka, later Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and many others. They accept Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So there is God, His name, His address, His activities, everything is there. If you accept, then you will benefit.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Well, nobody is dying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Woman</b>: Dying is parting, is the soul parting from the physical body (indistinct)....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So every, everyone everywhere is dying. Do you think in your country nobody dies? Is there any guarantee, that any, that nobody will die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Woman</b>: No, but everyone, everyone dies because this..., because this is the pattern and this is the cycle: you are born, you will live your life, you will die. Some people die young, some people die old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. India, India at the present moment, they have lost their culture. In India, five thousand years ago, when Maharaja Pariksit was there, one black man was trying to kill a cow. He immediately took his sword, the king. So "Who are you? You are killing cow in my kingdom?" The same India, the government is sanctioning ten thousand cows to be killed daily. So India is not the same India. India has lost its culture. You see? Therefore they are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Woman</b>: But everything is changing. Not only India is changing, every country is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So every country is suffering. Just they are suffering in one way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Devotee (1): California is suffering...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Suffering another way. Nobody is, is free from suffering. I have already explained. There are three kinds of suffering. So who is free from this suffering? You may not be suffering from any bodily disease, but you may be suffering from mental agony. You may not be suffering from mental agony, but you may suffer, suffering imposed by others. There are so many suffering. This place is suffering. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā, <i class="calibre3">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam</i>. This place is for suffering. <i class="calibre3">Duḥkhālayam. Duhkha</i> means suffering, alayam means place. <i class="calibre3">Asasvatam</i>. And still you cannot make adjustment. You, if you say "All right, let there be a little suffering. Let me stay here," that also will not be allowed. You will be kicked out: "Get out!" Then you have to accept another body. You do not know what kind of body. So these things are there. Don't think that a little happy life for ten years or twenty years is the solution of your problem. That is not solution. Real solution is different.

In this way he is suffering. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <i class="calibre3">ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān</i> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.151].
