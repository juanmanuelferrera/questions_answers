<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...from your audience?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, one of the main things is that they say, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa consciousness may be very nice, but many other things are also very nice, and everyone says that 'I am right.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right. Nice... Suppose if there is a nice staircase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that one, two, three, four, five, six, seven stairs. Still, one who has gone to the topmost nice stair, he has to be considered the topmost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> But then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything may be nice. Because Kṛṣṇa says: <span class="Italic">mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ:</span> "Everyone is trying to approach Me, but one who has approached two steps, he cannot say that he's equal to the person who has approached hundred steps."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, then they will say that everyone... The Christians would say that they're on the top step, and the Buddhists say they're on the top step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they may say, but if Kṛṣṇa is God, what He says, that we'll have to accept, what Kṛṣṇa says. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat: [Bg. </span>7.7] "There is no more superior than Me." That you have to accept. Everyone will say, "I am very good." But is that the fact, that everyone is very good? There is comparative, superlative degrees. Just like shopkeepers, they say, "All my goods are good." They are competition. One has to judge. That comparative study... What the highest Buddha philosophy? <span class="Italic">Ahiṁsā. Ahiṁsā,</span> nonviolence. That is our preliminary study. <span class="Italic">Amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam [Bg. 13.8].</span> There are many other things after <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā.</span> They do not know this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> There's another argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Another argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Many times, the professors, they say that "If God, if god were actually all, all-good and all-perfect, then when He created us, we would also be all-good..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you are contaminated. You are all-good. That's a fact. Because you are part and parcel of God, you cannot be bad. But you are contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, they say that "Even, even if I have the potential... Even to say that I ha..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got the potential. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> But if I say that... If I, I'm originally in the spiritual world, but even the potential to fall down is an imperfection in the creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, potential does not fall down. Just like a child has got the potency to pass the M.A. examination. So he has to be educated. If you don't educate him, he'll remain a foolish child. So we are educating to develop that potentiality.</div>
<div class="Verse">nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-prema sādhya kabhu naya<br class="calibre2"/>śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. madhya 22.107]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">They, that potentiality is eternal. God is eternal. We are eternal. Our relationship, eternal. Everything is eternal. But because we are small, minute fragments, sometimes we fall down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say, "God should have, God should have created us so that we..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you should dictate God? God has created perfectly. He has given you independence. You fall down. It is your fault. God has made you perfect, given you independence. But if you misuse your independence, you fall down. Just like government gives everyone opportunity. Why do you become criminal and go to the jail? That is your fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say that God should have created us so that we...</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why "Should have created"? He has created already perfect. Because you are perfect, therefore you have got the independence to misuse. You are not a dead stone. That is perfection. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> You can go anywhere, <span class="Italic">sarva-ga.</span> You can go to the Vaikuṇṭha. <span class="Italic">Yānti deva-vratā devān [Bg. 9.25].</span> You can go to the higher planets. You can go to the hell. When you go to the hell, it is your choice. God has given you all perfection. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate [Īśopaniṣad,</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">,</span> everything is complete, perfect, and because you are perfect, you have got the independence. But misusing that independence, you are imperfect. Again, reviving your independence, you can become perfect, although you are imperfect now. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means raising the imperfect to the perfect platform. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Other fools, they say, "We are perfect now." In a fallen condition also, they're thinking perfect. That is <span class="Italic">māyā. Āsurīṁ rākṣasīṁ caiva mohinīṁ prakṛtiṁ śritāḥ.</span> Kṛṣṇa has made you perfect. There is no doubt about it. Just like some of our students. All of a sudden, they deviate, go away. So what is that? Our movement is imperfect, or he's imperfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He's imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's imperfect. Our movement is perfect. But he becomes imperfect by his misuse of independence. He thinks that "This is nice," and goes to hell. What can be done? That independence is there. That is perfectness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So in other words, these, uh, the people that argue like that, they, they actually are lazy. They don't want to surrender to God. Then they blame God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they have become imperfect, therefore they are blaming God. "God is good;" they forget this. That is their imperfectness. One side, they say, "God is good." Still, they're blaming God. What is this nonsense? If He's God, God is good, how can you blame Him? God is good; in all circumstances, He's good. That is the meaning of good. Good does not mean that one time you are good and next time you are bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Just like the criminals blame the government for being in the prison house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, that is natural. Yes. <span class="Italic">Surāśū-sākṣimat. Surāśū-sākṣimat.</span> In the liquor shop so there was some trouble. So he went to court. He went to court. So the court asked him, <span class="Italic">"Where is your witness?"</span> So he brought one witness, drunkard. You see? <span class="Italic">Surāśū-sākṣimat.</span> So that is <span class="Italic">māyā, ahaṁ mameti [SB </span>5.5.8]<span class="Italic">,</span> misusing power and blaming God, "Why God...?" God has made everything. Just like here. It is made not to move. Stay. But we are better than this. Is it not? It cannot move. So God has made this also. But because we can move, we are better than this. And if, if, if they say that "God, why he has made me to commit mistake?" This rascal does not understand that that is freedom. You, why don't you take the right one? God says, "This is right." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why don't you take it? And still, how you can say God is bad? What is the argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Well, the argument is that if God is so all-powerful, why does He even let me fall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> If God is so powerful, why does He let me fall. Why doesn't He save me, save me from my own foolishness. Why doesn't He...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He's saving you, but you don't carry His order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Yes, but it's not recognized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like I say, "Chant sixteen rounds." If you do not do it. What can I do? That is your fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> If God were to force us, there'd be no love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No, no. Force is not good. Force is there. Force is there. The <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is another force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> There's a large segment of the population today who say, "We only speak about God in terms of our own relationships with each other." So one group, they say, "This is all male chauvinism, to say God is a male. Actually, we are saying now the women should be elevated so God is woman for us." They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God... But uh... Well, that's all right. God is male and female both. God, our God, sometimes He takes the form of female, <span class="Italic">Mohinī-mūrti. Mohinī-mūrti.</span> But comparatively studying, God is <span class="Italic">puruṣa,</span> male.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> He's always a potency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. He is potent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> He's always the supreme potency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is potential. That means you manufacture God. Sometimes you manufacture God as male, sometimes you manufacture God is female. Is it not? Is it not your theory? As you say, "Now we accept female as God," that means you manufacture God. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what you manufacture, is that God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you manufacture? You are imperfect. So whatever you manufacture, that is imperfect. How it can be God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Well, God is simply the way we view each other, relationship with each other, as the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is your manufacture. Why do you say like that? Each other's relationship? The relationship already there. What is to make new there? The already... God is great, and we are small. The relationship is already there. So how you can make another relationship? God is great. Is it not? God is great. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then what you are? You are small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So relationship already there. So what relationship you are creating again? It is already there. God is great; you are small. The relationship is already there. He's Creator. You are the created. He's the predominator. You are the predominated. He's the master. You are the servant. This is already there. And what new thing you can create? This is already there. He's master. And He's... Why you are covering? Because God has given this season. So you are dependent. You have to cover. You cannot make it immediately sunshining summer season. That is not within your power. Therefore He's great. You are small. This relationship is already there. Therefore He's master, you are servant. That is the real eternal relationship. What new relationship you can create. It is not possi... It is not possible. He's creator. Are you creator? Can you create anything? Then how you can be master? You are always servant. So relationship is already there. How you can change it? That is speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Actually, that philosophy is just atheism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That philosophy is atheism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atheism, yes. Atheism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They're not talking about God at all. They're just talking about something they're searching for, sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Yes. "Now we shall create female as God." What power you have got? God is already God. You cannot create God, a female, or dog. You can create anything, as you..., by mental speculation, but that is not a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They say, "Man was made in the image of God," and now women are saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They say, "Man was made in the image of God," and now women are saying, "Women are made in the image of God. Therefore God is female." And that is their logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, man or woman, you cannot create God. That is the first proposal. God is not your creation. You are creation of God. You cannot say, "God should be like this. God should be like that." That is nonsense. God is not under your dictation. You are under the dictation of God. That is God. If you manufacture, if you dictate, then how He is God? He's your dog. Just like a dog. He dictates. He abides by your order. He's not God. He's dog. What is the scientist says? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The scientist says that God didn't... One of the astronomers said that "If I were present at the time of creation..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, you were present. Therefore you are a rascal. You were not allowed to (be) present. Therefore God is great. You are a rascal. God did not allow you to be present there. Now you are lamenting. Therefore God is great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Because God doesn't lament. He laments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God did not allow you. Therefore you are under control of God. So you are foolish rascal. God did not allow you. Therefore God is great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> One very prominent philosopher, theologian, today named Martin Buber, he says we cannot talk about God as "He", describing so many attributes to Him as something other. He is the eternal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that we accept, that <span class="Italic">ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ:</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234] We cannot speculate about God with our imperfect senses. But that does not mean we should not know god. We cannot speculate, but there is process of knowing God. That is from God. When He says, "I am like this," that's all. You have to accept that. You cannot speculate. You cannot create. Just like a big man, a big master, nobody knows how many millions of dollars he has got. They are speculating. His servants are speculating, "Master may have so many millions. Master may have so many..." But that is all imperfect. When the master says, "I have got so much, so many millions," that is perfect. All other speculation, they're all imperfect. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are not speculating. We are accepting God the authority, and He's speaking about Himself. We are accepting. That is our position. Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat: [Bg. </span>7.7] "There is no more superior authority than Me." We accept it. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:</span> "You always think of Me. Become my devotee." We become... This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are imperfect, but we accept the perfect. Therefore we are perfect. We are imperfect. We don't say that we are God, or perfect. We are imperfect. But we accept the perfect version of the perfect. Therefore we are perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, then again they would say that many people say that they have perfect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Many, many different people say that they have the perfect information about God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they have, that's all right. But it should be tested whether they have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Tested?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Whether you have got perfect information or I have got perfect information, that is to be tested. I have no objection if somebody says that "I have got perfection, perfect information," but I'll have to see whether you have got. But I have no objection if you say. That is all right. Because if I have got perfect information, you may also have. There is no objection. But I have to test whether. Anybody can say, "I have passed M.A. examination." But I have to test whether he's actually M.A...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So who shall decide what the criteria is, to test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God will decide. The God's book is there, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like two lawyers fighting. Who will decide? The lawbook will decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> How will the judgement be rendered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> How will the judgement be rendered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They would ask.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Judgement will be rendered by lawbook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say they have their own lawbook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is kick on their face. (laughter) You are rascals. As soon as he says, "I have got my law books," he's a rascal. He's a rascal. Kick on his face with boot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> In the West, they don't accept the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as anything but a piece of mythology or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he has to accept something else. He has to accept something. He may accept Bible. They may not accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> They must accept Bible. But you have to, then you have to lead your life according to the version of the Bible. The version of the Bible is that "Thou shalt not kill." You are killing. Therefore you are not, not followers of Bible. You are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, their process is to discredit all scriptures so that they don't have to follow anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are discredited. Who follows your version? If you discredit others' version, who follows your version? Who are you? If you don't accept other authority, and who is going to accept your authority? Why shall I? You cannot become authority, that "I don't accept any authority." I have to follow that? Then you become authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They also argue, though, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all, understand. If he says that "I don't accept any authority," that means he becomes authority. I have to follow him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Then they say it's a, it's just like a stand-off then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That... Then they say "Well, it's a stand-off, that I say I'm right and that you say you are right. So it cannot be..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that, therefore there is confusion. The world position is like that. Now it is confusion. Everything is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Conflict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in confusion. That is chaotic condition. Every citizen says, "I don't accept government law. I have got my own law." It is confusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Where is the result of your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We can say, "Where is the result of your belief?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Confusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Confusion is not... Chaotic condition, confusion is not proper stage. That is a state of suffering. That is the position at the present moment. Otherwise, why they are fighting, nation to nation, man to man, group to group, community to community, diplomat to dip...? They're simply fighting like cats and dogs. This is not perfect society. Simply ca... They can say dogs. They can simply make barking, "Whowf! Whowf! Whowf! Whowf!" That is not perfect society. Human society should be sober. That is Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But one should follow the standard morality. When that standard set is lacking or it fails to understand, then people try to speculate their own thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. Nobody's following any standard. Just like these Western people, mostly Christians. It is clearly stated in the Bible, "Thou shalt not kill." They're simply killing. Their only business is killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> And divorce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And divorce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these rascals, how do they claim Christian? Eh? What do you think? They're not even category, in the category of dogs, cats, and they're claiming that "We are follower of Lord Jesus Christ."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> But they also argue, Prabhupāda, that that law, "Thou shalt not kill," "I am not killing. The others are killing. But I am not."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Is that very good argument? "I am not killing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But he's eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I am not killing the snake. My stick is killing." Is that very good argument? (laughter) These rascals, all these rascals, they avoid. "I am not killing. I am not responsible. My, my, this stick has killed." Just see. If you go to the court: "Sir, I have not killed, my stick has killed." Just see how rascal they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Wolfe:</span> It is a question whether this "Thou shalt not kill" does not also include all our animal brothers and sisters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Wolfe:</span> I think it should also include that. Because "Thou shalt not kill" is just not kill creatures, not only men. But apart from that, they do not even follow it where men come in. They kill. They do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Wolfe:</span> It should.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, "Thou shalt not kill" means everything.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The animals have no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they say? This is rascaldom. Therefore they are rascals. They do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> But they say, "We are more superior than the animals. So therefore the animal's business is just to give us food."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, then, then, the superior nation can kill inferior nation. Why you have made the United Nations?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It just encourage animalism, animal dominance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animalism. That is... Then it becomes "Might is right," not "Right is might."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> In the Bible, Prabhupāda, there is a statement that many people follow, saying that, where Jehovah says, "Man shall have dominion over the animals, over the fishes and..."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> And eat them?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but we don't kill them. We take their fruits and flowers. That does not mean it is killed. And that also we take it for Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if there is any responsibility, that is Kṛṣṇa's responsibility.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Wolfe:</span> And we cannot help doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to become servant of Kṛṣṇa; you are not responsible. Just like government servant, police, and military kills, but he's not responsible. He's not responsible. Their business is killing, soldiers, but they are rewarded: "Oh, thank you very much. Take this title." Just Arjuna, just like Arjuna killed on the order of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa gave him cert..., <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si priyo 'si me:</span> [Bg. 4.3] "You are My very dear friend.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> In the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like <span class="Italic">loke vyavāyāmiṣa-madya-sevā nityā hi jantoḥ.</span> There is tendency for eating meat. Therefore <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says that "You can eat meat, but..." Not only <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> in other scriptures also. The Jews also say. The Mohammedans also say that you can kill in the synagogue or in the, what is called, mosque, one animal. But not slaughterhouse. No religion prescribes that you open slaughterhouse. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> It's always done under...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is restricted. Why it is advised to kill in the synagogue? Why not publicly? That means it is not wanted, but if you go on killing in the mosque, some day you may come to your sense, that you are a rascal; you are becoming responsible. But if you open slaughterhouse, that sense will never come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And not to kill the cow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Especially not to kill cow. That animal is very, very important to the human society. According to the Vedic system, those who are meat-eaters, they are recommended to kill some goat or some other animal. Not cow.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We shall go this way? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They had a great difficulty. Because of poor fund of knowledge in the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> they formed doctrines, so many doctrines, where groups of men got together and said. "This is what we believe." And they have so many doctrines. Many people killed, fighting over these doctrines, and even the intelligent people will simply, instead of trying to find out about God, simply try to clarify these doctrines more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you say there are so many doctrines, that means that all of them are rascals. All of them are rascals. Otherwise, why there should be so many doctrines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> There's only one doctrine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> God is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, God is one. God is good. That is only one doctrine. And why there should be different doctrines? That means those who have created different doctrines means they're all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Because they deviated from the central point and became preoccupied with their own speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. That, that is not the process. First of all you have to know that God is unlimited. You are limited. How can you approach Him with your doctrine? Because you are limited, your ideas, your thinking, is limited. So how you can approach the unlimited? That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> These doctrines are simply veiled atheism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, They, they, they're everything, motivated. So therefore they're imperfect. I have got... Just like this United Nations. They have gone there for becoming united, but they remain disunited forever. Just see. All the best men go there for becoming united, but forever they will remain disunited. Just see the practical. Because they're all imperfect, rascals, motivated. How they can be united? They cannot be united. Simply spoiling their time and public money. That's all. Simply spoiling. But public have no eyes to see them. They're also rascal. Therefore my Guru Mahārāja used to say that the whole society's now combination of cheaters and cheated. That's all. The cheated want cheaters, and cheaters take the opportunity of the cheated. And that is the combination of the present day society. Somebody, they want to be cheated. And there are some cheaters. So the whole society is combination of cheater and cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Wolfe:</span> That is why nobody wants to change anything.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. Wolfe:</span> Because they all want to go on cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You see? That is the qualification of conditioned soul: To become a cheater, and to become cheated. This is the condition. To become a cheater is one of the conditions of material life. The four defects: He must commit mistake, he must be illusioned, and he must cheat, and his senses are imperfect. These are the four qualifications of the materialistic person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is also one of the qualities of bondage?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they are... Because they are, they have been bound up by the laws of nature, so these qualities they have developed.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Darkness has no separate existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Darkness means absence of light. That is darkness. It is the negation of light. Similarly, material life means forgetfulness of God. That's all... What is our spiritual life? We are simply trying to revive our understanding of God. That is spiritual life. And when you perfectly revive, that is spiritual. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa... [break] ...whatever you do, that is your defeat. Because you cannot see things in the proper perspective, therefore in darkness or in ignorance, whatever you do, that is your defeat. Therefore we see that so much advancement of education, civilization, but everything is defeat. Nobody's satisfied. Because it is defeat. It is not progress. It is defeat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We have to be led by someone who can see.</div>

Just like a blind man going, falling into the ditch, we say, "No, no. Don't go there. You'll fall down." But he becomes angry, "Why you are instructing me?" That is our thankless task. We have to do it. How we can see that this blind man is going...? He'll immediately fall and die. How we can remain silent? We must have to say. That is our business, that "For want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you are going to die. Take it. Be saved." But they do not like it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Uh? But a great soul will never cheat. One who cheats, he's not great soul. He's the menial soul. Soul is not menial or great, but he's covered by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Śaṅkara's cheating is also like that, because he was taking, he was accepting from the Buddhists. If he immediately says that "Lord Buddha was, cheated you," they'll not accept. Therefore he made some compromise. The Buddhist theory is "void," and he said, "No form." So it is almost the same. But he said, "There is Brahman." <span class="Italic">Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span> That much improvement. The same process. Just like one wants to eat meat. He is given some regulation, "Yes, you can eat meat. There is no harm. But you do like this: Go to a mosque. On <span class="Italic">Eid</span> day you can kill one animal." Or "You go to the synagogue under the protection of..." And our Hindu <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "Go to the Goddess Kālī's temple, and get a goat, black goat." That means under condition. If it is good thing, it would have been sanctioned, "Yes, you can do whatever you like." But it is not good. But if you say, "It is not good," he'll not accept. Therefore under some condition. [break]</div>

This kind of behavior is found amongst the pigs, amongst the dogs. Do you think we have to create a human society like the pigs' society? At the present moment, they're eating anything and everything like pigs, and they're having sex with anyone, never mind. So it is a pig society. There is no discrimination.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not... I don't accept. We don't accept. Why do they say "all over the country"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, I mean in schools, in colleges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have departments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They why they are complaining?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The intelligent students all criticize it. Many, many people criticize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I saw a big pamphlet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They've made...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that meditation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, they meditate for fifteen, twenty minutes... (indistinct) ...I think. You have to pay some money for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say, they say it will increase your sense gratification, make more money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> But they don't, they do not claim any spiritual benefit. It is only material benefit that they claim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They why "Transcendental"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Well, it's just a catchy name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have so many scientific tests like blood tests, the blood, circulation of the blood is improved, the mental condition is improved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all material. That has nothing to do with spiritual. Blood is not spiritual. It is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It may have some material advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Blood is there in the cats and dogs also. That is also circulatlng.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> A combination of psychotherapy and (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, they are saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even an animal, the blood circulation is better. Therefore he's better than transcendental meditation. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, they're saying that, uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the transcendental meditation is concerned with the blood circulation, you'll find in the animals, the blood circulation is first-class. Therefore above transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> In the same regard, they admire animals for that reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> In the same regard, they admire animals for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, actually, transcendental meditation is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but these people are saying that if I compare with a man who is practicing transcendental meditation with a normal man, then... They compare different, these tests, they're called physiological tests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That physiological test, you can do between man and animal. The animal will be found better. Their circulation of blood is most natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Also the state of mind which they claim is beneficial, the same state of mind can be reached more quickly by smoking opium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We know from experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. Calm state of mind, emitting alpha rays, alpha brain waves. Smoke opium you get the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Really? No, the intelligent students all know it's cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They say that's an easy way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Why not take the easy way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, we have to understand what is meant by transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That word they use wrongly. That is transcendental. They use the word "transcendental meditation," but it is not actually transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They had this one machine. They put a tester on the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring any student of transcendental meditation and talk with our student. He'll be kicked out immediately. That is the test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You're right, Prabhupāda. They're cheaters. I talked to one of their leaders at a college, and I, I defeated all their points. Then they simply became embarrassed and said, "Well, I don't want to talk any more." And they went away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's good. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They made this one machine to test how advanced they were.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It had a light bulb on it. So they put a thing on the person's head, and when he's in transcendental meditation, if the light bulb goes on, then he's in <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span> So one man came and smoked opium and put the machine on his head and the light stayed on. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are speaking of "transcendental," but testing by mundane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transcendental perfection is tested by mundane instruments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Boy, that's contradiction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They don't ever use the word "trans..." They just call it "TM."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> [break] ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, is what's called "linguistic analysis."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> So they don't want to find out really what God is, but simply what do you mean when you use the word "God".</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We mean God is great. That's all. There is no need of linguistic analysis. One word is sufficient. God is great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They would say the psychology of that is that you're suffering from an inferiority complex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh. You are inferior. You are being kicked every moment by the laws of nature. How do you claim that you are superior? Why you are covering? Because you are kicked by the laws of material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> There's no complex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question... You have to cover yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you say you are superior? You are inferior. As soon as you cover your body, you are inferior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say, "Well, we, I made this hat. So whatever inferiorities I have, I can conquer them by my intelligence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that intelligence, superior intelligence will never come to you. You'll always remain inferior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> What about death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are always inferior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They will prolong death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They will prolong death. They're trying to prolong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They're trying."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> A bit longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Ultimately, find there is no death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what...? Death is... What do you mean by death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Losing the material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that you are losing every day, every moment. You are not today what you were yesterday, that you are losing. So, how can you defeat? You are, every moment you are being defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There are some theories now. By turning the temperature, by cooling down little more than the body temperature, you can live longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, you can live little longer, but you cannot live forever. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They're freezing the body now, Prabhupāda, in the hopes that sometime in the future science will be able to make them come back to life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all future. That is all future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They take so much money for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The trouble is when they lower the body temperature, the sensitivity is lowered. Therefore enjoyment is also lowered. So it's a question of living for a few more years and enjoying less or enjoying more and living less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the government is very kind to them. They supply money to do research on that, thousands of dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is the government? Combination of some rascals. You are a rascal. You vote another rascal, and they combine together and become government. That's all. None of them are intelligent. I am rascal. So I must vote another rascal. And all those combination of rascals become government. And they cheat another, the rascals who voted them. That's all. Therefore it is a society of cheater and cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, for letting us walk with you this morning!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh!</div>
