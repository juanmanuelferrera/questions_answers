<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The prisoners.... Haridāsa Ṭhākura was very well known, so all of them assembled and offered him respect. Haridāsa Ṭhākura blessed them, "Stay in this condition." (laughs) So they were surprised, that "We offered respect, and the blessing is that 'Stay in this....' " Then they were explained, " 'Stay in this condition' means your attitude to offer respect to a Vaiṣṇava." That was the intent, not that "You stay in the prison house." Viṣṇu, Vaiṣṇava, offering respect.... [break] ...<span class="Italic">ārādhanam.</span> When Pārvatī inquired from Lord Śiva what is the best form of worship, he advised, <span class="Italic">viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param:</span> "Oh, to worship Lord Viṣṇu is the best form of..." Then he said, <span class="Italic">tasmāt parataraṁ devi tadīyānāṁ samarcanam:</span> "And greater than <span class="Italic">viṣṇor ārādhana,</span> Viṣṇu worship, is to worship <span class="Italic">tadīyānām,</span> anything in connection with Viṣṇu." Anything.... That is Vaiṣṇava. Just like we are worshiping <span class="Italic">tulasī, tulasī</span> plant. Why <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> plant? It is a plant only, not even human being. <span class="Italic">Tadīyānām.</span> Because <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> is liked by Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, anything in connection with Viṣṇu, to worship, that is better than Viṣṇu worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> King Pratāparudra, he got the clothes of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu sent some cloth to King Pratāparudra, and he worshiped it just like Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, I've got a handkerchief here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param.... (japa)</span> [break] ...philosophy is very, very difficult, undoubtedly. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span> Therefore I wrote that poetry, that "How they'll understand?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Does that mean difficult to understand or difficult to practice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very difficult to.... <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān-</span>everything to give up, except Kṛṣṇa. It is very difficult. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān.</span> They are proud if they are little rich. And America is very proud. They are trying to accumulate money, and we are trying.... We say, "Give up this nonsense." Is it very easy thing, that "For Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we shall give up everything, our attempt to earn money"? Nobody will accept it. "Our industry, our trade, our opulence-everything we shall leave?" But the meaning is that. Yes. Who will take it? <span class="Italic">Jñānīs,</span> yogis, the same thing-"Oh, I am so.... I am great yogi. So many people considers me that I am God, and I shall give up this profession?" Is it possible? Who will do it? <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> there is a verse, <span class="Italic">eta saba chāḍi' āra varṇāśrama-dharma, akiñcana hañā...(?)</span> That's it. <span class="Italic">Varṇāśrama,</span> even <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> one has to give up. (<span class="Italic">japa-</span>break) ...department asked me, "Swamiji, how long you want to stay here?" (laughs) I said.... I thought that "I have got this sponsoring one month, maybe another month. So two months." I thought, "Two months is a very long duration, because I'll not be able to do anything. As soon as I will put my program, they will be: 'Go away, please.' " I was under this impression. "Let me try." That is the subject matter of the poetry, that "I have no hope. Who will accept this, especially in this country, so much engrossed in materialistic way of life? And I shall say, 'Give up everything.' Who will take it?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But they have taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's also in the poem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That it is Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Supreme mystic.... "If You like, it is possible; otherwise not possible. From calculation it is impossible." That is the subject matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But nobody before you even tried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They came for some money or some reputation or "England-returned." The Bon Mahārāja, this Vivekananda, and all, all these rascals who are coming, that's all. They come for some money and woman, some prestigious position, the material things. For prestigious position, for money, for women, means it is all material. They have no spiritual idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This Reverend Moon, he has started a very big movement among Christians. His philosophy is that the mission of Jesus Christ was to have sex life so that there will be perfect children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see what nonsense he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And they crucified him before he was married.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even Christ.... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His philosophy is that Jesus Christ was crucified before he got himself married and had some children-"Therefore I am Jesus Christ again, coming to make children. I am the new Messiaḥ."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This rascal is.... And foolish persons are accepting him. How.... No, they are doing that. They are sanctioning homosex, sanctioning abortion. They've lost, Christianity and all.... (<span class="Italic">japa)</span> This is Beverly Hills? No. Rancho Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is nearby. [break] Today, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the biggest magazine in the West United States is coming to try to get your interview at 10 o'clock, 10:30 this morning, something like that. It's called <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Magazine.</span> It's for the West United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] And if we don't believe that they have gone to moon planet, they will reject us. They will immediately take as "Oh, these people are crazy." Even if you give sufficient reason or argument, they will not take it. That is their obstinacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They're convinced by the photographs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have some photographs of the men in the spacesuits walking around on that other planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But they are convinced because the scientists have told them. They believe the scientists. They have faith, and the scientists can tell them anything, and they'll believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is.... That is the disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They have put faith. Everyone has faith. You cannot live without having faith in somebody. So they put their faith in the scientists, and we are saying it is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nobody could possibly believe that the scientists would cheat them. They think they are very intelligent, honest men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got our faith-in Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, they have got their faith-in scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That article in the last BTG.... Sadāputa, he said, "So what it boils down to is they are putting their faith in chance, and we are putting our faith in God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is statement of the scientists. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā:</span> in everything, faith is the beginning. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā.</span> Without faith you cannot make any progress. [break] ...reporter, in 1970, he saw me. I told, "This is all simply childish." He remembers that. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is after eight years. Actually it is proved, and still, they.... [break] What is this dome?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wilshire, yes. I remember.... There is a park. Soldiers, there are soldiers in a corner. I used to come to that park. [break] ...this rich.... [break] ...is the costlier quarter in America. [break] ...he's got a house here.</div>

The ministers will enjoy it. This is democracy. Democracy means "Somehow or other, I capture the government, and whatever money you have got, I snatch it from you, and then I enjoy." This is democracy. <span class="Italic">Dasyu-dharma.</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said <span class="Italic">dasyu-dharma,</span> the business of the rogues. How is that? If I can earn some money and keep it for myself, I have no right? This is communistic idea: "Make everyone poor." Here is police, two cars. Police we saw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can't raise the standard up, so they bring it all down.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's their idea of equality. All men are equal, so no one should have more money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Make everyone a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They are so much envious of those persons with more money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India also, that.... "Make the rich pay."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In England also that's the prevalent theme now. That has accounted for the demolishing of the aristocracy in England more than anything, the government heavily taxing them so that anyone with money now is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is finished. In England aristocracy is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're all selling their property. They cannot maintain. Even the Queen cannot maintain her establishment, but because it's government.... The Buckingham Palace was not repaired for many years. Last time, when I went there, I saw it is repaired now. Before that, three, four times I went. It is blackish. The stone.... It is made of stone. The stone had become black. That means many years it was not repaired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What they do now if they have some big house in the country and they want to keep it, they have to put it on show during the summer months. They allow people to come, and they charge them so much money to come and look around.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They collect very sufficiently. I have seen. Again, inside you go, and a particular section, if you want to see, the another payment. Yes. First of all, entrance fee; then, within that, if you want to see another particular section, then another fee. And they are collecting money. I have seen. Śyāmasundara took me there.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> On Watseka Avenue, we have the temple and maybe seven other buildings, so we own more property and buildings than anyone here in Beverly Hills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have only one house-with great difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have the whole block.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, there are many taxes. Sales tax...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sales tax is there. But in India that..., at a stage, the whole amount is taxed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> There's an estate tax, an inheritance tax...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, mean at a stage.... This much, this much, this much.... And at a.... There is a stage-ninety-five percent government's. You keep only five percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They even tax you when you die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In England when someone dies, a rich man, he loses practically half his property and money and everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Fifty percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...just in what they call death duties. When you die, they take all your money away from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's in America also. If your father dies and he leaves you his wealth, the government will take half of it. You have written in the Fourth Canto that because the government is so expert in taxing, the people are becoming so expert in cheating the government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...to avoid the taxes. So the government is simply training the people how to cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And then you wrote that one day the people will..., the taxes will become so great that the people will revolt, refuse to pay, and then the government will be finished. There will be chaos. You're giving all these warnings, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You've also warned them about taking the oil from the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. I think of these things. No, there is analogy, just like when you fly in the sky, you take sufficient petrol in the wings, sufficient, so many thousands of gallons. And if there is no petrol, then you'll fall down. So I theorize these things, (laughs) that these planets are floating in the air on account of petrol. If you finish the petrol stock, then we drop. Analogy. Indirectly, my desire is that "Why you are wasting your time in this way? Your life is short here. Then utilize it for self-realization. What is the use of this civilization, civilization that for artificial necessities of life you waste your whole duration of life and next life you become a cat or dog? Suppose you are successful in this life manufacturing these big, big skyscrapers. Next life, if you become a cockroach in the same house, toilet room.... There is possibility." Kṛṣṇa..., <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> You have to change your body, and there is no guarantee that you'll have to change in this type of body. Any body. The cockroach is also a body. Therefore they don't believe in the next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You said they have developed so many different weapons, so they must use them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They will not waste their time making nuclear bombs and so on without using them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it is ordained by God that "You have manufactured this, and use it for your destruction." That is nature's way. Film companies, these are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Twentieth Century Fox. It is a very well known film company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Movie company. This is that park where we sometimes go. When they have this war it will reduce everything, just finish off all the industries and factories. So everything will be reduced to a primitive stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they will again repair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Again rebuild everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Germany.... Just like Germany was finished. The American planes bombed in such a way that Germany was finished, very heavily bombed. One lady in Hamburg, she was showing me one wall, big wall building dismantled, and it has become black on account of bombing. She was showing me how far injustice they have been done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So then after the war, nothing will change. System of government, the industries, everything will just be rebuilt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll try at least. Just like after the Second World War, Germany or England finished. They could not recoup. They are now poverty-stricken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Germany?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Germany is little recouped, but England is finished. Therefore I say India got independence not due to Gandhi. It is due to Hitler. That is my opinion. I have got reason. The Hitler fighting with England made them smashed, so their political power became nil almost, and on this opportunity, Hitler helped Subash Chandra Bose, one of the leaders of India, to organize Indian National Army. This Indian National Army, when attacked, at least made a show of attack from Imphala(?), especially on Calcutta dropped bombs, and the whole Calcutta became vacant. Perhaps myself and a few others remained. I sent my sons.... Of course, daughter was married, but they sent to Navadvīpa, Śrīdhara Mahārāja's <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> My wife refused to go out of Calcutta. She said, "I'll be bombed maybe, but I'll not go out." (laughs) So I had to remain in Calcutta. So I've seen bombing and Calcutta all vacant. And one day I was eating in the evening, at night-immediately bombing. <span class="Italic">Kachori...</span> I was hungry, (laughs) but the eating finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It was bombed frequently, or just once or twice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Almost daily. But it was meant for bombing the European quarters. So when the Britishers saw that "Now this Subash Bose has organized I.N.A...." I.N.A. was organized by Subash Chandra Bose. Outside India, all the Indians, they contributed money, especially from Singapore. Singapore, Hong Kong, this side..., all the Indians, they contribute sufficiently. And he got men from the fighting Indians soldiers. The Britishers, they were fighting with Indian soldiers, with Germany and Japan and others. So the contract with Hitler and Subash Bose was this, that "All the Indian soldiers which you arrest in the war, please give me them. Then I shall organize." So the soldiers, when they understood they're being arrested-"We shall go to Indian side"-they voluntarily surrendered. So Hitler, all others, Hitler and Japan, Tojo, arrest them and give it to Subash Chandra Bose, and he was organizing in Singapore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He had a large army?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Large or small, whatever; there was. But England had no soldiers. Whatever they did-fight-with the Indian soldiers, Gurkha and Sikh. Indian money, Indian soldiers, everything Indian-they were fighting. So when the Britishers saw that "The nationalism has come amongst the soldiers. It is not possible to maintain the Empire," they voluntarily gave indepen.... "Better give us good relations, and our business.... Make some agreement. But before departing, make them weak and divide Pakistan and India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That the British arranged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they are doing these things all in.... Wales.... What is called? Ireland, Germany. That is their business: divide and rule. Before leaving India, immediately they partitioned. Burma was Indian. Ceylon was Indian. So they had already divided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Made them all into separate states.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (<span class="Italic">japa)</span> Now England is finished. There are aristocrat type statues now rolling on the ground. Who takes care? Their, their Lennon? Lennon, John Lennon and George Harrison, they are purchasing big, big palaces. (<span class="Italic">japa)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> All the aristocracy, they just go out to work like anyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The lords are roaming on the street. I have seen many lords. They're ordinary.... Even they haven't got car. The Queen also, just like ordinary, common man. Royal family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> One day America will be poor like that also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Luxury leads to poverty. When the American becomes too much luxurious, they'll not be able to defend their country. Then it will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is the fear even now, that America has lost their fighting spirit against the Communists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes. Yes. Vietnam. It is proof. When the Vietnam is attacked, American soldiers, they began to fly, flee away, became afraid. Naturally. They were not soldiers. They have no fighting spirit. By force they have been made soldiers. Let them take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. America will be saved. (<span class="Italic">japa)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said yesterday, or a few days ago, that this movement will go on unimpeded for ten thousand years, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, provided we keep it uncontaminated. You should take this opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So after ten years we have gotten so many devotees and so many houses, so I can't imagine how big this movement will be after ten thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You'll get the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The whole world will be delivered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> America will be the best; people will follow. They are already following-skyscraper building, that's all. Any nation in the world, they are all aspiring to have skyscraper buildings. India has done? In Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Full of skyscraper buildings. Now they are thinking this is opulence, skyscraper building. When you are giving it up, no more skyscraper building, the others are imitating. Just like in this quarter you cannot construct skyscraper building. They don't want it. Now others are imitating: "Let us have skyscraper building like America." (<span class="Italic">japa)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This building is only two stories, even though it has three windows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why two story? There is ground floor, first floor, second floor, third floor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> One of the floors has two windows, top and bottom. But it's just one floor. Someone went inside and looked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Oh, that is not floor. There is no ceiling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, just three steps up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> All the instructions for the future-like you said that one day even we will have the government-how to run the government, everything is explained in your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I think like that. (laughs) Is there mention, "The slaughterhouse must stopped"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You've given all the major policies for the future government, Kṛṣṇa consciousness government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us hope. (end)</div>
