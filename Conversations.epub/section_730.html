<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Today they're going to put the steel on the second floor, and tomorrow they're supposed to start casting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That "tomorrow" is daily put. Every day it is put "tomorrow." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...of Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have spread the steel on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The steel is now in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The steel is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They put it in yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They'll be casting most of the floor today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Every fourteen days we'll cast a new floor. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the week days are set up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We have our own information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) You see, there is a little difference...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sunday, Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, Sunday, the sun is the center, and I mean, that is, I recall, first sun, and then Monday is next day, then Tuesday, which is next to the earth, and Wednesday next to the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then sun is first, then moon. But they say moon is first, then sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They say the moon is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So far the distance is concerned, moon may be nearest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it is, that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is so, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Our science says so. Your science may not. And we don't want to clash the sciences here. Let us talk about philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You science... (laughs) Jump over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Chandra is the <span class="Italic">upagraha,</span> isn't it? As guru has got many such <span class="Italic">grahas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is one of the celestial planets. And they say there is no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is not self-luminous. All <span class="Italic">grahas</span> are not self-luminous. When we observe in the sky, those stars are bleeping like this. The <span class="Italic">grahas</span> are straight as that, the Sukra behind us, just steady light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...philosophy is also incorrect, there is no life after death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who says so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, so many, all Westerners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Easterns... That does not mean... The Eastern philosophy is only with the <span class="Italic">jāgrati</span> stage. But the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> has got three stages, and the fourth stage, the <span class="Italic">turīya</span> stage, is the real stage that we understand. They don't have idea of it, unfortunately. So that philosophy is not the real philosophy of life. Life as a whole should have its own philosophy. They don't understand that there is anything beyond the <span class="Italic">jāgrati</span> stage. But then there is a <span class="Italic">svapna</span> stage, there is a sleep stage and the <span class="Italic">turīya</span> stage. In that if I am wrong you may correct me, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot be corrected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I cannot be wrong, say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I cannot correct you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You? You cannot be correct...? Why I should not be corrected? Because the philosophy must encompass the whole life, not a part of it. All Western philosophers, only except Schopenhauer and Eckhart, they only thought about the waking stage. They have never thought about the dream and the deep sleep stage and the stage beyond the three. None of them, excepting Eckhart of Germany. So the Western philosophers are all wrong or partially true. [break] The Western philosophers have never thought about the three other stages, none of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...philosophy rejects any philosophy based on thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But you see thinking is an apparatus which takes you beyond thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That takes you beyond thinking. You cannot go beyond thinking without thinking to be taken as a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But thinking must be intelligent thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But thinking is always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foolish thinking has no value. <span class="Italic">Indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur indriyebhya para mana manasas tu parā buddhir [Bg. </span>3.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> So thinking should be under the direction of intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Buddhi, buddhimān,</span> and <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra,</span> all are the internal apparatus, what you call <span class="Italic">antaḥ-kāraṇa.</span> They work together in reason. One thing does not act separately from the other, as we know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are separate arrangement, although they are one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are the different facets of the same internal organ as a whole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...set is there, but beyond that mental stage there is intellect. Beyond intellect there is soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> To go beyond intellect for a body conscious ego, the ego must dissolve and find itself to be a <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> and then he travels further up to find his own identity and his own relation with God. Before, I mean, mind is one, you cannot go beyond it. That is what my conjecture. I may be wrong for all that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. One has to go beyond the mind, but one, those who are stuck up with the mind, they are useless. So the Western philosophers, they are stuck up with the mind. That is the defect. [break] ...<span class="Italic">bhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā mano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ. Manorathena,</span> mental concoction, <span class="Italic">asataḥ.</span> Western philosophers, they take the mind as the soul. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. And the Communists think even the matter is more important than the mind. What do you call? Dialectical materialism, that the matter produces consciousness. It is not the consciousness which, I mean, collects matter around it. That is their philosophy. That is this dialectical materialism. They are absolutely wrong. They are even further down than the Western philosophers, mental philosophers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...is already mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur<br class="calibre2"/>indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>manasas tu parā buddhir...<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.42]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Buddhi tu... Paraṁ buddhva?</span> What is called, that...? <span class="Italic">Saṁsthābhyam ātmāna?</span> That mind has to... I mean, isn't it out for itself that it is false? That comes to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not false.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean false so far as higher category is concerned, the <span class="Italic">jīva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing is false, but there are different steps. One step is important than the other, but they are not false. Just like the water, the sand, then earth, then the building. You cannot construct a building here. So these are different stages of reality. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> So how many places you have arranged?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Program? Well, I have arranged two so far. At least, tentatively, Mr. Patel and Mr. Tarachand Gupta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tarachand Gupta is also member?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, he has taken a room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He has a big, a giant bungalow on Altamount Road on Malabar Hill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I think so. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...going to the West, and I was collecting some money, this gentleman gave me five hundred rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Tarachand Gupta. Really? He makes trains, train cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> He has got factory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A good business.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Where is the factory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's outside of Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...at his home, Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I don't think so. I haven't seen it, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I went to his house. He worships Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? You know it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> Yes, very well. The grandfather there does the worship, the old man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He is Tarachand Gupta, the old man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> No. There is one older man, or there was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the old man's name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I don't know. I haven't seen either the old man or the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is Tarachand Gupta? He is young man?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he appears to be good man. Yes. One day he met me at Hanging Garden, and he requested me that "One day you have to come to my house."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I remember. When we were at Akash Ganga, it was almost fixed up with Madhudviṣa Swami, but something...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is taken from the earth. There is no doubt about it. Why the scientists cannot take? This is a fact, that there is aroma, and the flower has taken the aroma from the earth. But why the scientists cannot take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They can make chemicals, the flavors. They can make flavors, aromas, from chemicals.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> I think if they want to produce rose flavor they must use the roses somehow or other. I don't think they can just produce.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Yes. They must use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are taking chemicals, making flavor, and the flower is coming out without any chemical. So who is more artist, better artist?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Should be. Because you calculate about the stars, very, very far away. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how you will take this instruction when Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]? If they do not take Kṛṣṇa, then how this instruction will be taken?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Actually, the real scholars of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> they admit that later on this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> came out, which was stressing more on <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Later on.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> He says that it was the Vaisnavites who introduced <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why Śaṅkarācārya has accepted <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> He is not a Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> That they cannot answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they're foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> That they cannot answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śaṅkarācārya has accepted <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Śaṅkarācārya accepted Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Lord. <span class="Italic">Sa bhagavān svaya kṛṣṇaḥ.</span> He has written...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> It is like that. They think that Śaṅkarācārya also liked <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but the personal Kṛṣṇa was not very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> According to his <span class="Italic">bhāṣya,</span> they think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he has written many prayers on Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ mūḍhā-mate.</span> That means those who are not worshiping Govinda, they are <span class="Italic">mūḍhā-mati.</span> He is addressing <span class="Italic">mūḍhā-mati:</span> "You rascal..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> This verse, Śrīla Prabhupāda, <span class="Italic">vāsudeva sata devam,</span> is also written by him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">vasudevaṁ-sutaṁ devaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaṁsa-cāṇūra-mardanam<br class="calibre2"/>devakī paramānandaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kṛṣṇaṁ vande jagat-gurum</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe, but I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Because they say, these mundane scholars, that <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> was after Śaṅkarācārya because he did not write a commentary on <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Because there's a mention of Kaṁsa and Cāṇūra and Vasudeva and Devakī, that means that Śaṅkarācārya did believe in the personal of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Vedavyāsa is after Śaṅkarācārya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> They don't accept it is written by Vedavyāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> They don't... They are such atheistic people, they do not accept that it is written by Vedavyāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but others accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Yes, the vast people do accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedavyāsa is accepted by Śaṅkarācārya. Vyāsadeva. Vyāsa-guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> They think that some Vaiṣṇava wrote it and put the name of Vedavyāsa. They are so demoniac.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they say like that. Then other <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they are also fools?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> I think they place all the other <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> after Śaṅkarācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācāryas...</span> But their <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system is very old. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> They don't accept it as... They do not accept <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> as spoken by some person Kṛṣṇa five thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, do they accept the authority of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> They say it's a very nice book of knowledge. They don't want to pursue spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why they become authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Yes, that is their rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they do not accept authority, why they become authority? Who will accept them? If everything is depending on mental speculation, then why they should be accepted as authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> That they cannot answer. Only insincere people, foolish people, they are misled by them. Otherwise I don't think anybody even knows their philosophy. Everyone knows your philosophy because they see your disciples, and no one goes to read their books. Mostly I see in their books, "First edition, copies, two thousand," "three thousand," something like that. And you never see a second edition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</span> for the last twelve years he was lying idle, and this time he went, and people appreciated so much he was giving delete.(?) He is advertising like that. (end)</div>
