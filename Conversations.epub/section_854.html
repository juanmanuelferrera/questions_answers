<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God created the soul and the matter also. Has he discussed anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God created everything. God created soul and the matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> The individual soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Well, then, how is the individual soul eternal if it has a beginning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we say there is no beginning. As God has no beginning, soul has no beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> No beginning, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na jāyate na mriyate vā.</span> That is the distinction between matter and soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They counter that if God is all-powerful, He can do anything. So why not He can create a soul and that soul can then be eternal from that point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Christian may argue that God is all-powerful, so God has created the soul, and from that point the soul is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soul is eternal, we admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But only from that point, not in the past.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not in the past?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, because according to Biblical philosophy you only have one lifetime in this world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then who goes to heaven?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Persons who adopt the principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if one life, then who goes to heaven and who goes to hell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very few go to heaven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone, if he goes to hell or heaven, then why do you say "one life"? Then another life. Otherwise what is the meaning of going to heaven or hell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. They get one chance to good or bad, and then finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They get one chance. Do good or bad. Then you either go to heaven or to hell. But you don't get another chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if he goes heaven means there is another life. How do you say "one life"? This is defective philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But this is what God has said in the Bible; therefore we must accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is what God has said in the Bible; therefore we must accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God, if He says something unreasonable, how it can be accepted? You say, "one life." Then who goes to the next life? That is defective. Why do you not talk back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...cannot explain why some people are born in a more pious setting and some people are born in a more impious setting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they do not know the <span class="Italic">karma. Karmaṇā daiva netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> According to one's activities, pious or impious, he gets the next birth. That is quite reasonable. But they do not believe in <span class="Italic">karma.</span> When I was student in Scottish Churches College, so we had to attend class, half an hour, Bible. So the Dr. Urquhart, he did.... The argument was: "So if <span class="Italic">karma</span> is there and I am suffering for my <span class="Italic">karma,</span> who is the witness?" But because they do not know that the witness is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He asked that question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he asked that question. [break] Paramātmā.... They say "Holy Ghost." What is that Holy Ghost?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Holy Ghost is supposed to give knowledge to persons who have embraced the teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore He is seeing what you are doing. So according to your action, the Holy Ghost gives you another birth. [break] ...<span class="Italic">sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati.</span> [break]...dictating everyone's heart, and He is observing. <span class="Italic">Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...contends that if a person does not become fully aware in this lifetime of God, then they don't have another chance, and they are condemned to hell for eternity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The hell or heaven doesn't matter. The next life is there. How you say "one life"? That is defective theory. Therefore this philosophy cannot be accepted. Anything which is defective is not to be accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Simply dogma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...rejected. That is Vedic process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually, there's so many different understandings that the Christians have of the same thing. They all have different type of philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> No, Christ never said that. Christ never said you only have one life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is real philosophy. That is real philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> This is the.... All of this evolved from the church fathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all defective, unscrupulous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] ...come up to us on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> and they are smoking a cigarette, and they say, "Do you accept Jesus Christ?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say, "You cannot be successful unless you accept Jesus Christ like us." But they were smoking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We accept. Rather, you do not accept. Jesus Christ said "Thou shall not kill." We strictly observe that, but you kill. You are not a Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "But that's just an ideal, the Ten Commandments. You're not expected to follow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is your explanation. That is your concoction. [break] ...take it. As soon as you disobey Ten Commandments, you are not a Christian. You are heathen. [break] And the thing is that religious faith should not be discussed on philosophy because everyone has got some, his own concocted faith. That is not philosophy. Faith is different. "I believe," "You believe," "I do not believe"-that is not philosophy. [break] ...philosophy in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that <span class="Italic">asmin dehe.... Dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> there is soul. This is philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, and philosophy without religion is mental concoction. So both of them should be combined. Then it is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...can be given, though, that man's logic is so tiny, pea brain, and God's logic is so great, so how can actually man discuss the logic of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The argument is given that God is infinitely great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't discuss. Sleep. If you cannot understand God's logic and God's philosophy, then don't discuss. Stop discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Jewish people say that you can't chant the name of God because it is too sacred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, too sacred, that's.... Actually that's a fact. And those who are too sinful, they cannot chant. [break] ...these ten kinds of offenses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] ...that God has put the world here for us to enjoy, so we will please Him by enjoying it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You go at four o'clock to your working place and come at night, ten. Is that enjoyment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> But on the weekend we can go to the beach. And we can eat whatever we want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you can go to hell also. Different thing.... [break] ...<span class="Italic">jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānu.</span> That is there. If you are suffering from disease, where is enjoyment? Mental discomfort, bodily discomfort. You are taking thrice pills for tranquillity. Is that enjoyment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say you have to take the good with the bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This nonsense enjoyment. Fool's paradise. For keeping the mind in tranquillity he is taking four times pills. For sleeping, he is taking pill. Does he enjoy that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> By suffering you can get a deeper appreciation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is enjoyment? Suffer. Then why is called enjoyment? By suffering you can.... (too much static-end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kuntī, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2)</b>: Purport. "This should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord. One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The question remains, then, How can a person engaged in abominable activities-either by accident or intention-be a pure devotee? This question may be justly raised. The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>. Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to under go certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But there is no such condition, because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is the only process to save yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: You..., you told a story once about, there was one, the devotee of Lord Caitanya, where he had never met Lord Caitanya, but he had some water sprinkled on him from a Muslim, Muhammadan, and that, that astrologer told him to pour..., to drink lead, hot lead. And he said, I was (indistinct)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Buddhimanta Khān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: Yeah, Buddhimanta Khān. (pause) You've also said in the past that there is no reality of this material world save for, save Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, save...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura (says), <i class="calibre3">nāma vinā kichu nāhika āra, cauddha-bhuvana-majhe</i>. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: Kṛṣṇa is our only insurance, and you are the, you are the insurance representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> People are so intelligent that when the representative of Kṛṣṇa speaks, they (indistinct) enemies, and sometimes they crucify, kill. So people are so kind that they are not killing. Otherwise, why Christ, (indistinct) was killed? What fault? What is his fault? Just see. Was there any fault in his words? He advised, "Don't kill," and he was crucified. We have to deal with such rascals. I may be representative, but he is directly son of God. People are so rascal that they did not believe even the son of God, what to speak of His representative. What is that? Why Jesus Christ was killed? What was his fault? People are (indistinct). What the Christians will ask? Therefore we are (indistinct) and not only that, they have been giving this idea that "For our sinful reaction Christ has taken contract, so let him suffer being killed(?)." Cow-killing is very, very sin, "That's all right; don't mind. Christ will suffer." How easy understanding they have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2)</b>: They...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2)</b>: They call it love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This is love? If you say, "Prabhupāda, I love you. Now I want to kill you. Now I will kill you." Please don't love me! (laughter) Please get out. "I love you so much that I will kill you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2)</b>: They like to keep the, Christ, the deity of Christ, they keep him nailed on the cross. They think that's very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore you see all the pictures in the Church, he is carrying the cross, and he is pushing, pushed by the government men. How miserable condition they show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2)</b>: They don't have any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They do not have picture, just like we show Kṛṣṇa is enjoying. Such rotten things. That is going on in religion. They love, they love means they want to see their lovable suffering so much, you see. Only then (indistinct). This, we want to see our lovable object that He is enjoying. Young boy, (indistinct) gopīs, and nice night, playing flute, He's enjoying. That we want to see. And they want to see that lovable he is suffering. How they can see it, if there is love?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2)</b>: If they loved him they would not be able to stand to look at that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is going on in the name of religion. Therefore so many rogues, rascals. Rascals. We say clearly (indistinct). Simply rogues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: That is the symptom. Then, if they loved him, they would not be able to see that and glorify that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That there was something (indistinct), one picture (indistinct). There was competition that painter has to paint a picture that there is (indistinct) of the mother with child, so what would be the facial expression. So the painter has to express the feelings (indistinct). That one painter he painted a picture of the mother, intimate picture. (indistinct). So that is real life. You may paint (indistinct) expression, that is artificial. The real thing, the mother cannot see it. That mother, that is (indistinct). It is (indistinct). So how the mother can see it? There is (indistinct) being killed. So it is not very easy to (indistinct) cover the mother, there is no question of him painting so many rascal expressions. That is (indistinct). All (indistinct) in the name of religion. All rascals. All rascal. Sinful. They do not know what is God, they do not know (indistinct) what is the meaning of love. Simply rubber-stamp: "I am Christian," "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim." They are interested only in sense ratification. There cannot be any religion. So this cheating type of religion is rejected. Dharmaḥ projjhita kaitavaḥ. All cheating type of religion is kicked out. This is no religion at all. All bogus. Is that religion, (indistinct) the instruction of Christ, (indistinct) kill Him. Is that religion? And they are showing how He was killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: One, one man once said that to carry, to glorify the cross is like they..., glorifying the revolver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, the same picture, that Jesus Christ is carrying his cross, and falling. (indistinct) and you go enjoy. (long pause) In Māyāpura you have seen Yoga-pīṭha, Caitanya Mahāprabhu birthplace? Yoga-pīṭha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2)</b>: Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Gṛhastha. Gṛhastha with two wives, he must enjoy. This is our process. Why you will see Him as a sannyāsī? Therefore Nityānanda prabhu broke (daṇḍa?). They want..., do not want to see Him as sannyāsī, (indistinct) renounce. Why He should be renounced? He is gṛhastha. "Oh, well." God must enjoy...

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: He said they did it independently, unauthorized from Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, and he already chastised them for using the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust label, 'cause it has nothing to do with the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Who is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: Uhhh, I'm not sure. Who sent it? Bahulāśva? That devotee named Bahulāśva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6)</b>: Bahulāśva and Bhakti dāsa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: Yeah, they printed it while the festival was going on in India, and he didn't know anything about it until he came back and saw that it was all printed. He said they were going to use it for some, something to do with lectures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: They were going to use it to introduce lectures and so forth.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: He mentioned those two. He didn't mention the others. He said they were...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: He said Bahulāśva and Dharmādhyakṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The idea is good, but (indistinct). Impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Impersonal is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: So if someone was to receive this, they wouldn't necessarily connect it with you at all. They could think it was anything, 'cause there's no mention of your name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Who published it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: Uhh, I don't know who printed it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That you did not ask?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: Rameśvara didn't know anything about who printed it or how many copies were printed or anything. He said all he knew was that it was put together by Bahulāśva and Dharmādhyakṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So ask them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: I have to, to contact them and find out how it was actually... Should I write them a letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He just sent one letter. You, you write.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: This letter? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh he, he is informed you are going?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...for (indistinct). (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7)</b>: Do you want to establish one center there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7)</b>: Yeah, I would like to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7)</b>: I would like to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. .....break.....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7)</b>: ...(indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, yes. Especially when there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7)</b>: (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This Ratha-yātrā is in memory of Kṛṣṇa's coming there with His brother and sister during one eclipse, to take bath, coming from Dvārakā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7)</b>: And the gopīs  also assembled there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The gopīs got the information that Kṛṣṇa is coming from Dvārakā, so from Vṛndāvana they went to see Him. And when Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī met, that Rādhārāṇī lamented that Kṛṣṇa-He was the same Kṛṣṇa and the same Rādhārāṇī-so "this is not a good meeting place. So, if You come to Vṛndāvana, then I shall be happy." So it is inviting Kṛṣṇa to Vṛndāvana. That is the feeling of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Ratha-yātrā. He is inviting Kṛṣṇa to Vṛndāvana. So in Jagannātha Purī still the same feelings are there. Kṛṣṇa, Jagannātha, from the temple goes to Guṇḍicā. So, Lakṣmī is angry that "Kṛṣṇa is leaving me, He has gone to Vṛndāvana." So she was, she is punishing. That is called Herā-pañcamī. Punishing the servants of Kṛṣṇa. The maidservants of Lakṣmī chastising them, threatened them, "Why without permission?" So they, out of very fearful condition, offering their respect to Lakṣmī, "Mother, you don't be sorry (indistinct), we are (indistinct)." So this, this is the play performed, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu associates they saw, and they enjoyed very much when the maidservant of Lakṣmī was slapping the servant of Viṣṇu. That is mentioned <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>. All the servants arrested, brought before Lakṣmī, and they are punished. But they came to invite Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī and other gopīs. And actually they do not go at that time. But this Ratha-yātrā ceremony means Kṛṣṇa is coming from Dvārakā to Kurukṣetra. This is the history of Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5)</b>: Do they have any temples of Lord Jagannātha there? They have any temples of Lord Jagannātha in Kurukṣetra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. Jagannātha, that is another history. King Indradyumna, he wanted to establish a temple of that incidence, and that the Deities while being carved would remain unfinished. So, he was very impatient to establish, so he established the unfinished Deity. That is Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7)</b>: The nondevotees cannot understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They are being carved, Kṛṣṇa's wood form, but he was so impatient, he said "Whatever is done now, establish." It is said that Viśvakarmā was enquiring. So the term was, Viśvakarmā said that "Unless I finish, don't open the door." So this king, he went impatiently, and calling out whether he is finished. Then he forced, forcibly opened the door, and it was unfinished. So he said "Never mind, (indistinct)." Unfinished Kṛṣṇa (indistinct). So Kṛṣṇa, finished or unfinished, is Kṛṣṇa. That is omnipotency. That is Jagannātha form, (indistinct) doesn't matter finished or unfinished. (end)</div>
