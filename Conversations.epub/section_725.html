<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Calcutta had called me up this morning. They are expecting about two <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> people in Māyāpur today and tomorrow. There's a big festival, and Jayapataka Mahārāja spoke to me also. He's going to come here next Wednesday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> During the next three, four day festival...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that festival?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's... It happens every year at this time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] Bengali <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i> is ready and Jayapataka Swāmī is taking delivery of it in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Copies. [break] They could not conclude when the battle of Kurukṣetra was fought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are speculating, though. There is one school which says it wasn't fought in Kurukṣetra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as there will be one school and other school, that means all of them are rascals. Just like the sun rises from this side. There cannot be two schools. If somebody says, "No, no. Sun rises from this side," if that is school, he's a fool. Sun rises from the eastern side. That's all. That is knowledge. If somebody says, "No, sometimes in the western side, sometimes in the northern side," is that any value? So as soon as there will be many schools, that means the conclusion is not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Someone was telling me, and I was telling that if somebody is not following the particular characteristic of a saintly person mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śastra,</span> they cannot be accepted as a <span class="Italic">sādhu. </span>So he was trying to prove that some <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> so-called, who eat meat, and who are drinking, they were actually great <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas. </span>And then I... He said that because in the previous ages there is mention of... In the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> there is mention that there were many <span class="Italic">ṛṣis</span> and <span class="Italic">munis</span> who were eating meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows them. He is such a rascal that he knows only and nobody knows. That is the verdict of this Rāmakrishna Mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They say that they would... These <span class="Italic">ṛṣis </span>would kill one elephant or something like that, and they would live on him for whole year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that information? Where he got this information? You did not challenge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Well, I said that that <span class="Italic">muni </span>must be just like the <span class="Italic">ṛṣis </span>and <span class="Italic">munis </span>you are talking about now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't find any such thing. In this way they have ruined Indian culture by misquoting, by misleading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And he admitted that Vivekānanda smoked <span class="Italic">gañja </span>and he was eating meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But for such a soul, he said, there is no conditioning like that. Then, when you quote any verse from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span>contrary to such statement, immediately he would say, "Well, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span>is not the only scripture."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...very nicely, without any fail. <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsām</span> [SB 1.2.8]<span class="Italic">. </span>But if he does not become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then where is the profit? It is simply waste of time and energy. <span class="Italic">śrama eva hi kevalam. </span>Anything, whatever it may be, it doesn't matter. <span class="Italic">Ye kṛṣṇa tattva vetta...</span> If he knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, then he is guru. <span class="Italic">Ye kṛṣṇa tattva vetta sei guru haya.</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> [break] ...people, they are nice pious people, and they have accepted some of these gymnastic people as their guru. So they say, "Oh, our <span class="Italic">guruji </span>is here. We have to go see our <span class="Italic">guruji,</span>" this, that. So how should we speak to them or how should we preach to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you cannot do immediately unless he understands your philosophy. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless they understand that this philosophy is better than that, how he can give it up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Sometimes they even say that "You have your guru and I have my guru. It's all the same thing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and a thief has also a guru. Then that guru is also the same thing. (Hindi) Here guru means <span class="Italic">tasmād gurum prapadyeta jijñāsur śreya uttaman [SB </span>11.3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Nāpnuvanti mahātmānam saṁsiddhiṁ paramaṁ gataḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Isn't there some conditioning between the guru and <span class="Italic">śiśya,</span> that "The guru should be like this and a <span class="Italic">śiśya </span>should be like this"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Not that anybody can say, "I am <span class="Italic">śiśya,</span>" and not anybody can say, "I am guru."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁsara-dāvā.</span> You are singing daily. <span class="Italic">Saṁsara-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam **.</span> One who can deliver from this entanglement of material, miserable condition of life, he is guru. That is the first definition of guru. <span class="Italic">Saṁsara-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam, prāptasya kalyāṇa-</span>one who has obtained this qualification-<span class="Italic">vande guroḥ śrī caraṇāra...,</span> he is guru<span class="Italic"> **</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> 'Cause nowadays...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nowadays... Nowadays let them talk all nonsense. But this is the definition of guru. "Nowadays the sun is rising on the western side." If somebody says like that, who is going to accept it? "Nowadays." There is no question of "nowadays" and "formerly." The truth is truth always. Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> So many <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> and <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> and everything going on, everywhere you see. It's so hard...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ prayair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ</span> [SB 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">. </span>Those who are very intelligent, those whose brain clear, they, <span class="Italic">yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ prayair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">What <span class="Italic">yajñas </span>they will perform? Not possible. Where is the <span class="Italic">yajñic brāhmaṇa?</span> [break] "Don't talk. I am very busy." (laughter) [break] ...greatest contribution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "The greatest contribution of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is its authorized translations of Vedic literature." Oh, "The greatest contribution to scholars." No. "The greatest contribution of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is that it is providing to scholars authorized translations of these Vedic literatures."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the remark of a very big professor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, how do we support our challenge that they have not gone to the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> How do we support our challenge to the scientists that they have not actually gone to the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First proof is that they say that there is no life. That is foolishness. There is life. Because we find everywhere life, why not in the moon planet? And there are many others. The first challenge is this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They say that they have not seen the life, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what you can see, rascal? Therefore we say you are rascals. Why do you believe your eyes? You cannot see so many things. We don't find any living entity in the ocean. Does it mean there is no living entity? So what is the value of your seeing? That is the defect. They believe in too much their eyes. Although eyes are... Every sense is imperfect. You can see here: "Oh, we don't find anything. It is all zero." Does it mean the sky is zero? There are millions of planets and millions of living entities. So that is their rascaldom. They think that they are perfect. Whatever they see, that is perfect. That is their mistake. If I say, "No, there is no life. I cannot see," is that very good statement? And in the..., externally you don't find any living entity, but is it void of living entities? Then why shall I assert that "There is no living... I cannot see"? Is that very good proposal? Therefore they are rascals. There cannot be any place within this universe which is without life. There cannot be. We see there is life even within sand. How you can say there is no life? "Because I cannot see." What is this argument? What you are? You are a rascal. Because you cannot see, therefore we have to accept? First of all we say you are rascal. And if he says that "I cannot see," is it to be accepted? And the example is there. "I cannot see any life. It is simply water." But there are millions and trillions of life, big, big fish. Where is your perfection of seeing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Prabhupāda? Why are the big authorities, like the government people...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is authority. That is our first assertion. Nobody is authority. Therefore we have placed Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa is only authority. All rascals. That is our first assertion-(aside:) Good morning-that except Kṛṣṇa there is no authority. And one who follows Kṛṣṇa, he is authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Why are the so-called scientists trying to make the common people believe that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are so-called scientists. You have already explained. Why you are asking? (laughter) You have already explained, "so-called scientists." That's all. They are not scientists; they are so-called scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Why do they want to fool the people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are fool. Because you are fool, therefore you become befooled. We do not become befooled by their words. You are fool; you will be befooled. If you want to remain fool, then you will be befooled. And if you become intelligent, then you will not be befooled. They can befool when there are many fools. If there is no fool they cannot befool. So you follow this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jaya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> The scientists, they are also fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3): </span>The scientists are also fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> That is our definition in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So much educated? <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā āsuraṁ-bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span> Their knowledge has no value. The <span class="Italic">māyā </span>has taken away everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta jñānā. </span>Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Honor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. Unless one understands Kṛṣṇa... <span class="Italic">Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Veda means knowledge. So all kinds of knowledge, they are aiming at the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So if one does not understand what is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā-</span>he has no knowledge. Knowledge means ultimately he must know what is God. That is knowledge. <span class="Italic">Ye kṛṣṇa tattva vetta sei guru haya.</span> Anyone who knows Kṛṣṇa, he becomes guru. Otherwise not. The first test is you may be scientist, philosopher, educationist, whatever you may be, but ask him, "Do you know Kṛṣṇa?" If he says, "No," then he is a fool. That's all. This is the test. (chuckles) Hare Kṛṣṇa. So Ambarisa Mahārāja, do you agree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ambar<span class="Bold"></span></b>ī<span class="Italic"><b class="calibre4">ṣ</b></span>a: Yes. It's a good test.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Goldsmith, they take a stone, black stone. Do you know? And they rub the gold on the stone, and they can immediately say whether it is gold or not. So our, that stone, is Kṛṣṇa. If anyone knows Kṛṣṇa, then it is gold. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol! Jaya </span>Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise it is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> It is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. Formerly these goldsmith boys, their father simply taught how to test gold. And as soon as he learns, he opens a shop and he earns thousands and thousands of rupees. No education. Simply by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes. Even today the jewelers' sons, they are expert in knowing diamonds and they make millions of rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (6):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Indian old fashion. They simply know how to test jewels and gold. That's all. One knowledge makes him rich.</div>
<div class="Verse">vyavasāyātmikā buddhir<br class="calibre2"/>ekeha kuru-nandana<br class="calibre2"/>bahu-śākhā hy anantāś ca<br class="calibre2"/>buddhayo 'vyavasāyinām<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>2.41]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><i class="calibre3">Avyavasāyinām bahu-śākha</i>. And <span class="Italic">vyavasāyayinām-</span>one. From practical point of view, from business point of view also, I started this Kṛṣṇa conscious business with forty rupees. Now we have forty <span class="Italic">crores. </span>Who has got such business success? (laughter) Bring anyone. Within ten years. And here is Ambar<span class="Bold">ī</span><span class="Italic">ṣ</span>a Mahārāja. He is ready to give us any money, any amount of money, Ambar<span class="Bold">ī</span><span class="Italic">ṣ</span>a Mahārāja, yes, whole Ford Company. (laughter) So who has got this business? Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. </span>I think there is no such history in the world, to begin business with forty rupees, and within ten years it becomes forty <span class="Italic">crores. </span>One cannot imagine even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) "You are servant, and wherefrom you will get twelve <span class="Italic">lakhs </span>of rupees within three years? You cannot get it." (Hindi) Busy. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Learn from dog one lesson. They are very faithful to the master, very faithful. [break] ...do not see anything now in the sky. Does it mean it is vacant? So what is the value of your seeing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> There's a philosophy that says that if a tree falls down in a forest and I am not there to see it, then it hasn't happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda: :</span>Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is their logic? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Want to see everything with their own eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja: :</span>They think the existence of the tree is dependent on their sense perception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gladstone or what, that poet? "Full many flowers' gloss unseen." Therefore there is no flower? "Full many flowers' gloss unseen." This is foolish philosophy. Now this plane is going. After half an hour it will not be seen. Does it mean it is finished? (laughter) There is no more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> But also in the sky we can see something. I can see many things. I can see something. It is not vacant space. Only thing I don't know what it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you cannot see the stars. Can you see the stars now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then can you say there is no star? Then? That means what you cannot see, that is not final. Therefore our Vedic instruction is <span class="Italic">śāstra cakṣusāt:</span> You should see through the<span class="Italic"> śastra,</span> not you these useless eyes. These are useless. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārtham sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> In order to know perfectly, one should go to the guru.

<div class="Purp-para">"One who has seen, go there and learn it." That is the injunction. Don't try to see yourself. That is foolishness. This very word is used, <span class="Italic">tattva-darśinaḥ,</span> "one who has seen." You have to go there and see through his eyes, through his instruction. That is real seeing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5): :</span>They're paying you respects, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Oh. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> No one has any chance against your philosophy. No one has any chance. Many times people start arguing.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, another <span class="Italic">śloka </span>is made by Rūpa Gosvāmī. He is praying to Kṛṣṇa that "As a young man has got attachment for young woman and young woman has got attachment for the young man, similar attachment, when I'll have upon You?" This is very natural to young men and young women, attachment. The whole world is going on on this, what is called, sex attachment. <span class="Italic">Puṁsam striya mithuni-bhavam etad.</span> This material world means they are combined together on the platform of sex. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunadi-gṛhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">. </span>So that is a very great attachment.
